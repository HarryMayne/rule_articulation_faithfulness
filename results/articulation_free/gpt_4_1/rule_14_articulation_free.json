The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have single words or very short phrases.\n3. **Structure**: True examples' quoted strings are usually phrases or sentences, often with at least three words. False examples are often single words or two-word phrases.\n4. **Case**: False examples often have quoted strings that are single words and are capitalized (e.g., \"Closed\", \"Exit\", \"Denied\", \"Paused\", \"ON\", \"A12\", \"Sales\", \"North\", \"Restart\", \"LOCKED\", \"SALE\", \"Success\").\n5. **Content**: True examples' quoted strings are more like instructions, notifications, or descriptive phrases, not just labels or statuses.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- True: \"seat change requested\" (3 words)\n- True: \"home team wins\" (3 words)\n- True: \"great work team\" (3 words)\n- True: \"tap card here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"project final review\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fragile items only\" (3 words)\n- True: \"call for details\" (3 words)\n- True: \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words)\n- True: \"wet surface ahead\" (3 words)\n- True: \"start trail here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\n- True: \"last train delayed\" (3 words)\n- True: \"defense get back\" (3 words)\n- True: \"matinee starts early\" (3 words)\n- True: \"sold out now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"door left open\" (3 words)\n- True: \"annual budget summary\" (3 words)\n- True: \"helmets on now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"take your card\" (3 words)\n- True: \"sample processing complete\" (3 words)\n- True: \"thunderstorm watch\" (2 words) -- exception? But \"until 9\" is not in quotes.\n- True: \"package at reception\" (3 words)\n- True: \"family letters 1984\" (3 words)\n- True: \"road work ahead\" (3 words)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- True: \"walk-ins welcome\" (2 words) -- exception? But \"before noon\" is not in quotes.\n- True: \"maintenance in progress\" (3 words)\n- True: \"maintenance mode active\" (3 words)\n- True: \"do not disturb\" (3 words)\n- True: \"no more delays\" (3 words)\n- True: \"markets in turmoil\" (3 words)\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"Closed\" (1 word)\n- \"Exit\" (1 word)\n- \"Denied\" (1 word)\n- \"Paused\" (1 word)\n- \"4K\" (1 word)\n- \"R\" (1 word)\n- \"Holiday\" (1 word)\n- \"Idea\" (1 word)\n- \"Warning!\" (1 word)\n- \"1998\" (1 word)\n- \"ON\" (1 word)\n- \"A12\" (1 word)\n- \"Sales\" (1 word)\n- \"North\" (1 word)\n- \"y\" (1 word)\n- \"Restart\" (1 word)\n- \"hope\" (1 word)\n- \"Mom\" (1 word)\n- \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word)\n- \"Syncing\" (1 word)\n- \"A5\" (1 word)\n- \"Blue\" (1 word)\n- \"LOCKED\" (1 word)\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\" (4 words) -- but this is False. Exception.\n- \"Queued\" (1 word)\n- \"SALE\" (1 word)\n- \"Success\" (1 word)\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least three words, and not be a proper noun phrase or a label. But the main discriminant is the number of words in the quoted string.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (2 words) is True.\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (2 words) is True.\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\" (4 words) is False.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: The quoted string must be at least three words, or if two words, must not be a generic label or status. But \"walk-ins welcome\" and \"thunderstorm watch\" are more like notifications or instructions, not just labels.\n\nBut \"Welcome to the fair.\" is a greeting, not an instruction or notification.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: The quoted string must be at least three words, or if two words, must contain a verb or be an instruction/notification, not a label or greeting.\n\nBut since the function is string-based and simple, the most likely rule is: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\n### Final Function\n\nSo, the function is: Return True if the quoted string contains at least three words.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and count the number of words.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 3\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 3\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often a single word or a short code.\n\n2. **Content of quoted text**: True examples often contain phrases that are instructions, statuses, or messages, often with multiple words. False examples are often single words, codes, or abbreviations.\n\n3. **Capitalization**: Many False examples are all uppercase or single capitalized words. True examples are often in sentence case or lower case, or at least not all uppercase.\n\n4. **Number of words in quotes**: True examples almost always have more than one word in the quoted text. False examples are often a single word.\n\n5. **Special characters**: False examples sometimes have numbers or codes.\n\n6. **The new example**: \"Mom\" is a single word, so it was classified as False.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is likely: The quoted text must contain more than one word.\n\n### Test this hypothesis\n\n- \"group work rules\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"sample processing complete\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"quality purposes only\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"runners take positions\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"home team wins\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"share your ideas\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"annual budget summary\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"package at reception\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"seat change requested\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"watch your step\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"maintenance mode active\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"new business\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"extra time added\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"great work team\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"quiet on set\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"low memory warning\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"keep back clear\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"helmets on now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"doors closing\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"project final review\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"access level mismatch\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"battery critically low\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"meeting moved\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"card reader error\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"who is there\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"favorite summer city\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"markets in turmoil\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"exam starts promptly\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"lifetime free updates\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"motion withdrawn today\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"WingB\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Restart\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Open\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Error404\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"SOLDOUT\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ON\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"AIR\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"8\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Soon\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Insert\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"X\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"12:00\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"B-12\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Offline\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ugh\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Ready\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"WPS\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"LOCKED\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Closed\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"4K\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"LowBattery\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ASAP\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Login\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Syncing\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"OK\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"PAID\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"A5\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"OPEN\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"FRAGILE\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Mom\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain more than one word.\n\n### Python function\n\nTo implement this, we need to extract the quoted text and count the number of words.\n\nAssume the quoted text is always in double quotes.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    text = m.group(1)\n    words = [w for w in text.strip().split() if w]\n    return len(words) > 1\n```\n\n### JSON output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    text = m.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in text.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) > 1\"\n}\n```"

suddenly.\n- The flyer said \"free entry today\" in bold letters.\n- The app flashed \"update available now\" during class.\n- He whispered \"stay very still\" in the dark.\n- The guide wrote \"start

received\" on the invoice.\n- The taxi's light read \"off duty now\" in red.\n- The homepage banner said \"maintenance in progress\" for hours.\n\n#### False Examples:\n- The exhibit case reads \"No.7\".\n- A small tag said \"SALE\" in red.\n- The cube face is marked \"R\".\n- The storefront banner read \"SALE\".\n- The key read \"Master\".\n- The file was named \"notes.txt\".\n- The phone flashed \"LowBattery\".\n- The trophy base reads \"MVP\".\n- The runway sign showed \"A5\".\n- The backlit sign reads \"EXIT\".\n- The remote screen read \"4K\".\n- A sticky note said \"ASAP\" and

to the fair.\n- The router lights flashed \"WPS\".\n\n### Patterns\n\n- In True examples, the quoted text is always more than one word, and always lowercase (or at least, not all uppercase or title case).\n- In False examples, the quoted text is often a single word, or an acronym, or a number, or a file name, or a title case word, or all uppercase.\n- In True examples, the quoted text is a phrase, often in all lowercase, sometimes with numbers, but never a single word or acronym.\n\n#### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (no uppercase letters except possibly for numbers).\n\nLet's check for exceptions:\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (True): three words, all lowercase except for the number.\n- \"project final review\" (True): three words, all lowercase.\n- \"see you soon\" (True): three words, all lowercase.\n- \"off duty now\" (True): three words, all lowercase.\n- \"open late\" (True): two words, all lowercase.\n- \"disk nearly full\" (True): three words, all lowercase.\n\nNow, False examples:\n- \"No.7\" (False): one word and a number, but \"No\" is capitalized.\n- \"SALE\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"R\" (False): one letter.\n- \"notes.txt\" (False): one word, contains a dot.\n- \"LowBattery\" (False): camel case, one word.\n- \"MVP\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"A5\" (False): one word, contains a number.\n- \"EXIT\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"4K\" (False): one word, contains a number.\n- \"ASAP\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"AJ\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"HALFTIME\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"OPEN\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"hope\" (False): one word, all lowercase.\n- \"1-0\" (False): numbers and a dash.\n- \"Ready\" (False): one word, title case.\n- \"8\" (False): one number.\n- \"Password\" (False): one word, title case.\n- \"AIR\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n- \"Warning!\" (False): one word, title case, with punctuation.\n- \"WPS\" (False): all uppercase, one word.\n\nBut \"hope\" is all lowercase, one word, and is False. So, the rule is not just about lowercase, but also about the number of words.\n\n#### So, the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (except for numbers).\n\nLet's check for True examples with uppercase:\n- None. All True examples have only lowercase words (and numbers).\n\n#### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted text must contain at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (or numbers).\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text, split it into words, and check that there are at least two words, and that all words are lowercase or numbers.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- Punctuation: Should be stripped from words.\n- Numbers: Allowed.\n- Words: Must be all lowercase.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Split into words (allow numbers)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    for w in words:\n        if not (w.islower() or w.isdigit()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    for w in words:\\n        if not (w.islower() or w.isdigit()):\\n            return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often a single word or a short phrase.\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often contain multi-word phrases, sometimes with function words (articles, prepositions, etc.), and often look like natural language sentences or commands. False examples are often single words, abbreviations, or exclamations.\n3. **Capitalization**: False examples often have quoted text in all caps or title case, while True examples are often in sentence case or lower case.\n4. **Presence of Spaces**: True examples almost always have at least one space in the quoted text, i.e., at least two words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nLet's check this against the last example:\n\n- The wallet card said \"Silver\". (\"Silver\" is a single word, so False.)\n\nThis matches the classification.\n\n### Python Function\n\nSo, the function should extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return \" \" in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return \\\" \\\" in quoted\"\n}\n```"

The False examples' quoted strings are all single words or single tokens (e.g., \"VIP\", \"Done\", \"Paused\", \"Blue\", \"Error404\", \"ASAP\", \"notes.txt\", \"4K\", \"AJ\", \"hope\", \"MVP\", \"Queued\", \"Update\", \"Open\", \"LOCKED\", \"STAFF\", \"Perishable\", \"Master\", \"Silver\", \"HALFTIME\", \"Delayed\", \"Insert\", \"Closed\", \"A12\", \"1998\", \"LowBattery\", \"AIR\").\n4. The True examples' quoted strings are always at least two words (e.g., \"free entry today\", \"chef's special tonight\", \"helmets on now\", \"open late\", \"maintenance in progress\", etc.).\n5.

It should not be in all uppercase or title case, and should not be a code, number, or exclamation.\n\n### Let's try to formalize this:\n\n- The quoted text must contain at least two words (words = sequences of letters).\n- The quoted text must not be all uppercase.\n- The quoted text must not be a code (contains digits or is a short acronym).\n- The quoted text must not be a single word.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Extract the quoted text.\n- Check if it contains at least two words (words = sequences of letters, at least two).\n- Check that it is not all uppercase.\n- Check that it is not a code (contains digits or is a short acronym).\n\nBut the main discriminant seems to be: at least two words, not all uppercase.\n\n### Let's write the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters)\n    words = re.findall(r'[A-Za-z]+', quoted)\n    # Must be at least two words\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Must not be all uppercase\n    if quoted.isupper():\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'[A-Za-z]+', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    if quoted.isupper():\\n        return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function matches the observed pattern in the examples."

Or is it because it is a greeting, not an instruction, announcement, or status? Or is it because the quote is not closed? Let's check if any True examples have a greeting or a closed quote.\n\nAll True examples have a closed quote.

Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples have longer quoted strings, often more than one word. False examples are often a single word or a short code.\n3. **Case**: True examples' quoted strings are in all lowercase or mostly lowercase, while False examples are often in all uppercase, title case, or a single word.\n4. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are usually phrases (multiple words), while False examples are single words or codes.\n5. **Special Characters**: False examples sometimes have numbers or special characters in the quoted string (e.g., \"1-0\", \"No.7\", \"A5\").\n6. **Capitalization**: True examples' quoted strings are in sentence case or all lowercase, rarely all uppercase or title case.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must be a phrase of at least two words, all in lowercase (or mostly lowercase), and not a single word, code, or in all uppercase/title case.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"matinee starts early\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"defense get back\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"low memory warning\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"HALFTIME\" (False): 1 word, all uppercase.\n- \"Offline\" (False): 1 word, title case.\n- \"y\" (False): 1 letter.\n- \"EarlGrey\" (False): 1 word, camel case.\n- \"favorite summer city\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"double feature tonight\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"1-0\" (False): code.\n- \"Exit\" (False): 1 word, title case.\n- \"back in 5\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase, includes a number.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"back in 5\" (True): includes a number, but is a phrase.\n- \"annual budget summary\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"bears active today\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"GA\" (False): 2 letters, all uppercase.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe quoted string must be at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (except possibly numbers).

Both True and False examples have this.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: In True examples, the quoted string is always more than one word. In False examples, the quoted string is often a single word or a code (\"A1\", \"STAFF\", \"Bake\", \"CLIP\", \"Open\", \"Exit\", \"37C\", \"Armed\", \"SALE\", \"A5\", \"Start\", \"Eco\", \"Success\", \"No.7\", \"Mute\", \"Home\", \"PAID\", \"OK\").\n3. **Multi-word Quoted Strings**: In True examples, the quoted string is always at least two words.\n4. **Single-word Quoted Strings**: In False examples, the quoted string is always a single word or a code.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- True: \"disk nearly full\" (3 words)\n- True: \"storm surge warning\" (3 words)\n- True: \"access level mismatch\" (3 words)\n- True: \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\n- True: \"engine temperature high\" (3 words)\n- True: \"seat change requested\" (3 words)\n- True: \"free entry today\" (3 words)\n- True: \"once upon a time\" (4 words)\n- True: \"maintenance mode active\" (3 words)\n- True: \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words)\n- True: \"payment received\" (2 words)\n- True: \"no known allergies\" (3 words)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- True: \"we are ready\" (3 words)\n- True: \"let dough rest\" (3 words)\n- True: \"gate change incoming\" (3 words)\n- True: \"new business\" (2 words)\n- True: \"last train delayed\" (3 words)\n- True: \"please knock\" (2 words)\n- True: \"love over fear\" (3 words)\n- True: \"motion withdrawn today\" (3 words)\n- True: \"low memory warning\" (3 words)\n- True: \"matinee starts early\" (3 words)\n- True: \"sold out now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"share your ideas\" (3 words)\n- True: \"quality purposes only\" (3 words)\n- True: \"all aboard now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- True: \"annual budget summary\" (3 words)\n- True: \"great work team\" (3 words)\n- True: \"best coffee here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"new friend request\" (3 words)\n- True: \"open late\" (2 words)\n\n- False: \"WingB\" (1 word)\n- False: \"STAFF\" (1 word)\n- False: \"SALE\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Bake\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Restart\" (1 word)\n- False: \"A12\" (1 word)\n- False: \"12:45\" (1 word)\n- False: \"2\" (1 word)\n- False: \"CLIP\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Open\" (1 word)\n- False: \"LowBattery\" (1 word)\n- False: \"LOCKED\" (1 word)\n- False: \"North\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Exit\" (1 word)\n- False: \"37C\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Armed\" (1 word)\n- False: \"SALE\" (1 word)\n- False: \"A5\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Start\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Eco\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Welcome to the fair.\" (But this is a sentence, but the example is False. Let's check the text: The poster says \"Welcome to the fair.\" -- but the period is outside the quote, so the quoted string is \"Welcome to the fair. -- which is 4 words. But the example is False. This is an exception.)\n- False: \"Success\" (1 word)\n- False: \"No.7\" (1 word)\n- False: \"A1\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Mute\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Home\" (1 word)\n- False: \"PAID\" (1 word)\n- False: \"OK\" (1 word)\n\nThe only exception is \"Welcome to the fair.\" which is 4 words, but the example is False. Let's check the context: \"The poster says 'Welcome to the fair.\" -- but the quote is not closed, so maybe the rule is that the quoted string must be at least two words AND the quotes must be properly closed.\n\n### Final Rule\n\n- The string must contain a quoted substring (enclosed in double quotes).\n- The quoted substring must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find all quoted substrings\n    matches = re.findall(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    # Return True if any quoted substring contains at least two words\n    return any(len(m.split()) >= 2 for m in matches)\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    matches = re.findall(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    return any(len(m.split()) >= 2 for m in matches)\"\n}\n```"

All are one word.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words, and not be a single word or acronym.\n\nLet's check the False example: \"PAID\" (1 word) - False.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted text must contain at least two words (words are sequences of letters, possibly including apostrophes).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted text from the input string, count the number of words, and return True if there are at least two words.\n\nAssume the quoted text is always in double quotes.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r\"[A-Za-z']+\", quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r\\\"[A-Za-z']+\\\", quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **True Examples**: The quoted strings in True examples are all multi-word, lower-case, and often phrase-like, not single words or codes.\n3. **False Examples**: The quoted strings in False examples are often single words, codes, abbreviations, or capitalized words.\n4. **Capitalization**: True examples' quoted strings are all-lowercase (except for proper nouns, but none seem present), while False examples are often all-caps or title case.\n5. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are at least two words, often more.\n6. **Content**: True examples' quoted strings are natural language phrases, not labels, codes, or single words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string contains at least two words, all in lowercase (no uppercase letters), and is not a single word or code.\n\n### Test the hypothesis\n\n- \"off duty now\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"road work ahead\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"LOCKED\" (False): 1 word, all uppercase.\n- \"OPEN\" (False): 1 word, all uppercase.\n- \"two for one\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"A1\" (False): 1 word, code.\n- \"1-0\" (False): code.\n- \"matinee starts early\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"favorite summer city\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"new friend request\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"back in 5\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase, but includes a number.\n\nNumbers are allowed if the phrase is otherwise natural language.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"back in 5\" (True): includes a number.\n- \"tap card here\" (True): 3 words, all lowercase.\n- \"service begins\" (True): 2 words, all lowercase.\n- \"soon\" (False): 1 word, all lowercase.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least two words, all lowercase (ignoring numbers and punctuation), and not be a single word or code.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted string.\n- Remove punctuation.\n- Split into words.\n- Check that there are at least two words.\n- Check that all words are lowercase (ignore numbers).\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Remove punctuation except for numbers and spaces\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    # At least two words\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # All words must be lowercase or numbers\n    for w in words:\n        if not (w.islower() or w.isdigit()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    for w in words:\\n        if not (w.islower() or w.isdigit()):\\n            return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```"

The False examples are almost always a single word, code, or very short phrase.\n\nBut let's check for exceptions:\n- \"thread locked now\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"let dough rest\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"open late\" (True, 2 words)\n- \"please knock\" (True, 2 words)\n- \"who is there\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"phones on silent\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"love over fear\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"disk nearly full\" (True, 3 words)\n- \"service begins\" (True, 2 words)\n\nBut \"Delayed\" (False, 1 word), \"VIP\" (False, 1 word), \"Sales\" (False, 1 word), \"Login\" (False, 1 word), \"Open\" (False, 1 word), \"STAFF\" (False, 1 word), \"Student\" (False, 1 word), \"Denied\" (False, 1 word), \"Insert\" (False, 1 word), \"hope\" (False, 1 word), \"Success\" (False, 1 word), \"Tue\" (False, 1 word), \"ON\" (False, 1 word), \"A1\" (False, 1 word), \"Update\" (False, 1 word), \"FRAGILE\" (False, 1 word), \"Silver\" (False, 1 word), \"LowBattery\" (False, 1 word), \"WPS\" (False, 1 word), \"ASAP\" (False, 1 word), \"1-0\" (False, 1 word), \"MVP\" (False, 1 word), \"1998\" (False, 1 word).\n\n\"Welcome to the fair.\" (False, 4 words) -- this is an exception, but it ends with a period. Let's check if punctuation is a factor.\n\n\"Welcome\" (False, 1 word), \"Welcome to the fair.\" (False, 4 words, but with a period), \"once upon a time\" (True, 4 words, no period).\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must be a phrase of at least two words, and must not be a single word, code, or number. Also, perhaps the phrase must not end with punctuation (like a period).\n\nBut \"let dough rest\" (True) is 3 words, no punctuation. \"thread locked now\" (True) is 3 words, no punctuation. \"service begins\" (True) is 2 words, no punctuation.\n\n\"Welcome to the fair.\" (False) -- ends with a period.\n\n\"once upon a time\" (True) -- no period.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must be at least two words, and must not end with a period.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the function\n\nSo, the function should:\n- Extract the quoted text (the first occurrence of text between double quotes).\n- Split it into words (using whitespace).\n- If the number of words is at least 2, and the quoted text does not end with a period, return True.\n- Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nHere is the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    if quoted.strip().endswith('.'):\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    if quoted.strip().endswith('.'):\\n        return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```"

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have a single word or a short code.\n3. **Case**: False examples often have the quoted string in all uppercase or title case, or a single word. True examples are often in all lowercase or a phrase.\n4. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are usually more than one word.\n5. **Punctuation**: Not a clear pattern.\n6. **Lexical Content**: True examples' quoted strings are often instructions, statements, or phrases, not just labels or single words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is likely: The quoted string contains more than one word (i.e., at least two words).\n\nLet's check this against the examples:\n\n- True: \"chef's special tonight\" (3 words)\n- True: \"stay very still\" (3 words)\n- True: \"modern art wing\" (3 words)\n- True: \"engine temperature high\" (3 words)\n- True: \"markets in turmoil\" (3 words)\n- True: \"update available now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"we are ready\" (3 words)\n- True: \"let dough rest\" (3 words)\n- True: \"tap card here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"milk almost gone\" (3 words)\n- True: \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words)\n- True: \"contents under pressure\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words)\n- True: \"quiet on set\" (3 words)\n- True: \"access level mismatch\" (3 words)\n- True: \"best coffee here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fragile items only\" (3 words)\n- True: \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words)\n- True: \"two for one\" (3 words)\n- True: \"double feature tonight\" (3 words)\n- True: \"low memory warning\" (3 words)\n- True: \"prepare for landing\" (3 words)\n- True: \"phones on silent\" (3 words)\n- True: \"quality purposes only\" (3 words)\n- True: \"processing your request\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words)\n- True: \"open late\" (2 words)\n- True: \"meeting moved\" (2 words)\n- True: \"take your card\" (3 words)\n- True: \"package at reception\" (3 words)\n- True: \"once upon a time\" (4 words)\n- True: \"window sensor fault\" (3 words)\n- True: \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- True: \"call for details\" (3 words)\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"Northwest\" (1 word)\n- \"GO\" (1 word)\n- \"AIR\" (1 word)\n- \"LTE\" (1 word)\n- \"Student\" (1 word)\n- \"FRAGILE\" (1 word)\n- \"CLOSE\" (1 word)\n- \"Idle\" (1 word)\n- \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word)\n- \"Open\" (1 word)\n- \"Exit\" (1 word)\n- \"Paused\" (1 word)\n- \"Welcome\" (1 word)\n- \"SALE\" (1 word)\n- \"Restart\" (1 word)\n- \"B-12\" (1 word)\n- \"37C\" (1 word)\n- \"WingB\" (1 word)\n- \"Blue\" (1 word)\n- \"Offline\" (1 word)\n- \"CLIP\" (1 word)\n- \"12:00\" (1 word)\n- \"Open\" (1 word)\n- \"No.7\" (1 word)\n- \"URGENT\" (1 word)\n- \"Update\" (1 word)\n- \"8\" (1 word)\n- \"1-0\" (1 word)\n- \"y\" (1 word)\n- \"Warning!\" (1 word)\n\nThere are a couple of True examples with two words (\"open late\", \"meeting moved\"), but all False examples are single words or codes.\n\n### Final Rule\n\n**If the quoted string contains at least two words, return True. Otherwise, return False.**\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted string and count the number of words.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequence of letters/numbers/apostrophes)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+(?:'\\w+)?\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\nBut to be robust, let's use a simpler word split:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: In True examples, the quoted string is usually more than one word, often a phrase or a sentence. In False examples, the quoted string is often a single word or a very short phrase.\n3. **Lexical Properties**: True examples' quoted strings are at least three words long. False examples are usually one or two words, or a single code/label.\n4. **Exceptions**: Let's check for exceptions. For example, \"room twelve ready\" (True) is three words. \"GA\", \"X\", \"ON\", \"SALE\", \"VIP\", \"Eco\", \"Master\", \"Insert\", \"Denied\", \"Charging\", \"MVP\", \"notes.txt\", \"GO\", \"HDR\", \"North\", \"Holiday\", \"STAFF\", \"B-12\", \"Silver\", \"Success\", \"Done\", \"y\" are all one word or a code.\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"open late\" (False? No, it's True. Only two words. Contradicts the hypothesis.)\n- \"paint this wall\" (True, three words.)\n- \"that was close\" (True, three words.)\n- \"access denied today\" (True, three words.)\n- \"tap card here\" (True, three words.)\n- \"clear the area\" (True, three words.)\n- \"favorite summer city\" (True, three words.)\n- \"off duty now\" (True, three words.)\n- \"call for details\" (True, three words.)\n- \"maintenance mode active\" (True, three words.)\n- \"phones on silent\" (True, three words.)\n- \"early bird yoga\" (True, three words.)\n- \"keep back clear\" (True, three words.)\n- \"room twelve ready\" (True, three words.)\n- \"payment received\" (True, two words. Contradicts the hypothesis.)\n- \"card reader error\" (True, three words.)\n- \"matinee starts early\" (True, three words.)\n- \"package at reception\" (True, three words.)\n- \"love over fear\" (True, three words.)\n- \"evacuate to lobby\" (True, three words.)\n- \"lifetime free updates\" (True, three words.)\n- \"start trail here\" (True, three words.)\n- \"best coffee here\" (True, three words.)\n- \"share your ideas\" (True, three words.)\n- \"all aboard now\" (True, three words.)\n- \"once upon a time\" (True, four words.)\n- \"seat change requested\" (True, three words.)\n- \"gate change incoming\" (True, three words.)\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True, three words.)\n- \"defense get back\" (True, three words.)\n- \"exam starts promptly\" (True, three words.)\n- \"home team wins\" (True, three words.)\n- \"operation complete\" (True, two words. Contradicts the hypothesis.)\n- \"do not disturb\" (True, three words.)\n- \"maintenance in progress\" (True, three words.)\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\nBut \"payment received\" and \"operation complete\" are True, but only two words. So maybe the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words.\n\nBut then, \"Holiday\", \"GA\", \"X\", \"ON\", \"SALE\", \"VIP\", \"Eco\", \"Master\", \"Insert\", \"Denied\", \"Charging\", \"MVP\", \"notes.txt\", \"GO\", \"HDR\", \"North\", \"STAFF\", \"B-12\", \"Silver\", \"Success\", \"Done\", \"y\" are all one word and are False.\n\nAre there any False examples with two words? Let's check:\n\n- \"room twelve\" (No)\n- \"payment received\" (True)\n- \"operation complete\" (True)\n- \"card reader\" (No)\n- \"matinee starts\" (No)\n- \"package at\" (No)\n- \"love over\" (No)\n- \"lifetime free\" (No)\n- \"start trail\" (No)\n- \"best coffee\" (No)\n- \"share your\" (No)\n- \"all aboard\" (No)\n- \"once upon\" (No)\n- \"seat change\" (No)\n- \"gate change\" (No)\n- \"family letters\" (No)\n- \"defense get\" (No)\n- \"exam starts\" (No)\n- \"home team\" (No)\n- \"operation complete\" (True)\n- \"do not\" (No)\n- \"maintenance in\" (No)\n\nSo, all True examples have at least two words in the quoted string. All False examples have only one word or a code.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters/numbers separated by spaces).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted string (the first substring between double quotes).\n- Split it into words (split by whitespace).\n- If the number of words is at least 2, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    words = m.group(1).strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often a single word or a short code (\"SALE\", \"OFF\", \"A1\", \"VIP\", \"Mute\", \"Charging\", \"HOT\", etc.).\n\n2. **Content of quoted text**: True examples often contain a phrase that is a message, instruction, or warning, not just a label or a single word.\n\n3. **Lexical property**: It seems that the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n4. **Testing the hypothesis**:\n   - True: \"paint this wall\" (3 words), \"two for one\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"gate change incoming\" (3), \"no more delays\" (3), \"please knock\" (2), \"extra time added\" (3), etc.\n   - False: \"Boarding\" (1), \"SALE\" (1), \"Idea\" (1), \"STAFF\" (1), \"Syncing\" (1), \"OFF\" (1), \"Done\" (1), \"Welcome to the fair.\" (but this is a phrase, so maybe punctuation matters?), \"Meeting\" (1), \"A5\" (1), \"Student\" (1), \"Mute\" (1), \"A1\" (1), \"VIP\" (1), \"Northwest\" (1), \"Perishable\" (1), \"Draft\" (1), \"37C\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"Bake\" (1), \"Charging\" (1), \"ugh\" (1), \"ASAP\" (1), \"8\" (1), \"LOCKED\" (1), \"HOT\" (1).\n\n   - \"Welcome to the fair.\" is False, but it's a phrase. But the period is outside the quote, so maybe the rule is about the number of words inside the quotes.\n\n5. **Edge cases**:\n   - \"see you soon\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"operation complete\" (True, 2 words)\n   - \"group work rules\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"please knock\" (True, 2 words)\n   - \"disk nearly full\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"access denied today\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"low memory warning\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"watch your step\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"stay very still\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"milk almost gone\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"all aboard now\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"walk-ins welcome\" (True, 2 words)\n   - \"processing your request\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"payment received\" (True, 2 words)\n   - \"wet surface ahead\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"family letters 1984\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"early bird yoga\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"who is there\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"best coffee here\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"door left open\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"engine temperature high\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"road work ahead\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"package at reception\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"defense get back\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"phones on silent\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"seat change requested\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"new friend request\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"invoice overdue notice\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"contents under pressure\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"clear the area\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"gate change incoming\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"paint this wall\" (True, 3 words)\n   - \"two for one\" (True, 3 words)\n\n   All True examples have at least two words in the quoted text.\n\n   All False examples have only one word or a code in the quoted text.\n\n### Rule\n\n**If the quoted text contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space), return True. Otherwise, return False.**\n\n### Python function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted text and count the number of words.\n\nAssume the quoted text is always in double quotes.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers separated by whitespace)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

(I classified as False.)\n\n### Step 3: Compare the quoted text\n\nLet's look at the quoted text in True examples:\n- \"fragile items only\"\n- \"phones on silent\"\n- \"road work ahead\"\n- \"sold out now\"\n- \"early bird yoga\"\n- \"thread locked now\"\n- \"invoice overdue notice\"\n- \"door left open\"\n- \"keep back clear\"\n- \"who is there\"\n- \"once upon a time\"\n- \"markets in turmoil\"\n- \"love over fear\"\n- \"no known allergies\"\n- \"fresh eggs daily\"\n- \"great work team\"\n- \"tap card here\"\n- \"no more delays\"\n- \"battery critically low\"\n- \"extra time added\"\n- \"premium trial extended\"\n- \"last train delayed\"\n- \"milk almost gone\"\n- \"thank you all\"\n- \"watch your step\"\n- \"meeting moved\"\n\nNow, False examples:\n- \"Done\"\n- \"12:00\"\n- \"Ready\"\n- \"root\"\n- \"Northwest\"\n- \"AIR\"\n- \"Delayed\"\n- \"Idle\"\n- \"ON\"\n- \"X\"\n- \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\n- \"Meeting\"\n- \"Draft\"\n- \"LTE\"\n- \"VIP\"\n- \"LowBattery\"\n- \"Closed\"\n- \"Sales\"\n- \"CLOSE\"\n- \"Soon\"\n- \"Mom\"\n- \"OFF\"\n- \"Holiday\"\n- \"Success\"\n- \"A1\"\n- \"North\"\n- \"Insert\"\n- \"URGENT\"\n- \"8\"\n- \"Start\"\n- \"Update\"\n- \"SALE\"\n- \"notes.txt\"\n- \"4K\"\n- \"Denied\"\n- \"payment received\" (from the new example)\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nLooking at the quoted text, True examples are all multi-word, lower-case, natural-sounding phrases, often with at least three words, and never a single word or a single number or a single code. False examples are often single words, codes, numbers, or very short phrases.\n\nBut there are some False examples with two words: \"LowBattery\", \"Northwest\", \"notes.txt\", \"payment received\", \"extra time added\" (True), \"premium trial extended\" (True), \"great work team\" (True), \"no more delays\" (True), \"thank you all\" (True), \"watch your step\" (True), \"meeting moved\" (True), \"thread locked now\" (True), \"sold out now\" (True), \"invoice overdue notice\" (True), \"door left open\" (True), \"keep back clear\" (True), \"who is there\" (True), \"once upon a time\" (True), \"markets in turmoil\" (True), \"love over fear\" (True), \"no known allergies\" (True), \"fresh eggs daily\" (True), \"tap card here\" (True), \"last train delayed\" (True), \"milk almost gone\" (True), \"battery critically low\" (True).\n\nSo, the True examples always have at least two words, but so do some False examples.\n\nBut \"payment received\" is two words, but I classified it as False.\n\nLooking closer, the True examples' quoted text always contains at least three words.\n\nLet's check:\n- \"fragile items only\" (3)\n- \"phones on silent\" (3)\n- \"road work ahead\" (3)\n- \"sold out now\" (3)\n- \"early bird yoga\" (3)\n- \"thread locked now\" (3)\n- \"invoice overdue notice\" (3)\n- \"door left open\" (3)\n- \"keep back clear\" (3)\n- \"who is there\" (3)\n- \"once upon a time\" (4)\n- \"markets in turmoil\" (3)\n- \"love over fear\" (3)\n- \"no known allergies\" (3)\n- \"fresh eggs daily\" (3)\n- \"great work team\" (3)\n- \"tap card here\" (3)\n- \"no more delays\" (3)\n- \"battery critically low\" (3)\n- \"extra time added\" (3)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (3)\n- \"last train delayed\" (3)\n- \"milk almost gone\" (3)\n- \"thank you all\" (3)\n- \"watch your step\" (3)\n- \"meeting moved\" (2) <-- exception\n\nWait, \"meeting moved\" is only two words and is True.\n\nBut in the False examples, \"payment received\" is two words and is False.\n\nIs there another pattern? Let's check the verbs used in the main sentence.\n\nIn True examples, the quoted text is a phrase that is not a single word, not a code, not a number, and is not a label or a status, but a natural phrase, often a command, a notice, or a message.\n\nBut \"payment received\" is a message, but is False.\n\nIs there a difference in tense? \"payment received\" is past tense, but \"meeting moved\" is also past tense.\n\nIs there a difference in the presence of a verb in the quoted text? Let's check:\n\n- \"fragile items only\" (no verb)\n- \"phones on silent\" (no verb)\n- \"road work ahead\" (no verb)\n- \"sold out now\" (sold = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"early bird yoga\" (no verb)\n- \"thread locked now\" (locked = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"invoice overdue notice\" (no verb)\n- \"door left open\" (left = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"keep back clear\" (keep = verb)\n- \"who is there\" (is = verb)\n- \"once upon a time\" (is = implied)\n- \"markets in turmoil\" (in = preposition)\n- \"love over fear\" (no verb)\n- \"no known allergies\" (known = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"fresh eggs daily\" (no verb)\n- \"great work team\" (no verb)\n- \"tap card here\" (tap = verb)\n- \"no more delays\" (no verb)\n- \"battery critically low\" (no verb)\n- \"extra time added\" (added = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (extended = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"last train delayed\" (delayed = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"milk almost gone\" (gone = verb, but used as adjective)\n- \"thank you all\" (thank = verb)\n- \"watch your step\" (watch = verb)\n- \"meeting moved\" (moved = verb, but used as adjective)\n\nSo, the True examples' quoted text is always at least two words, and never a single word, code, or number.\n\nBut in the False examples, the quoted text is always a single word, code, or number, or a two-word phrase that is a status or label, not a message.\n\n\"payment received\" is a status, not a message.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must be at least two words, and

False examples are often single words, codes, or labels.\n\n3. **Case**: False examples often have quoted text in all uppercase or title case, or are single words. True examples are often in all lowercase or sentence case, and are longer.\n\n4. **Presence of spaces**: True examples' quoted text almost always contains at least one space (i.e., more than one word). False examples are often a single word, no spaces.\n\n5. **Special characters**: Not a clear pattern.\n\n6. **Verbs**: True examples often have verbs in the quoted text.\n\n7. **Summary**: The most consistent pattern is that True examples have quoted text with at least two words (i.e., at least one space), while False examples are single words or codes.\n\n### Test the hypothesis\n\n- \"quiet on set\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"exam starts promptly\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"update available now\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"new friend request\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"who is there\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"defense get back\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"door left open\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"we are ready\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"seat change requested\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"tap card here\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"quality purposes only\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"motion withdrawn today\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"engine temperature high\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"stay very still\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"storm surge warning\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"start trail here\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"please knock\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"contents under pressure\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"matinee starts early\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"let dough rest\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"best coffee here\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"processing your request\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"off duty now\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"access denied today\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"love over fear\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"sold out now\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"1998\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"OPEN\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Sales\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Home\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"HALFTIME\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"LowBattery\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"LOCKED\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Paused\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Restart\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"A12\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"A5\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Blue\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"X\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Meeting\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"ASAP\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Offline\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"CLIP\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Welcome\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"WingB\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Master\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"root\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\" \u2014 4 words, but False (but note the period is outside the quote, so maybe the quote is \"Welcome to the fair)\n- \"HOT\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"A1\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"STAFF\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"VIP\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"WPS\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"CONFIDENTIAL\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"ON\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Armed\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"B-12\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Update\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"MVP\" \u2014 1 word\n- \"Syncing\" \u2014 1 word\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: **The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).**\n\n### Edge cases\n\n- \"please knock\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"let dough rest\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\" (False) \u2014 4 words, but the period is outside the quote, so the quoted text is \"Welcome to the fair\", which is 4 words.

For example, \"package at reception\", \"fragile items only\", \"prepare for landing\", \"call for details\", \"contents under pressure\", etc.\n- False examples: The quoted text is always a single word, a code, or a very short phrase, e.g., \"Delayed\", \"OK\", \"12:00\", \"R\", \"A1\", \"Sales\", \"8\", \"Exit\", \"CLIP\", \"root\", \"Queued\", \"AIR\", \"Start\", \"Eco\", \"WingB\", \"Holiday\", \"ugh\", \"LOCKED\", \"LTE\", \"Northwest\", \"37C\", \"y\", \"A5\", \"Blue\", \"Closed\", \"Home\", \"Paused\".\n\n### Step 4: Test the hypothesis\n\nIs the rule: \"The quoted text must be more than one word\"?\n\nLet's check some True examples:\n- \"package at reception\" (3 words)\n- \"fragile items only\" (3 words)\n- \"prepare for landing\" (3 words)\n- \"call for details\" (3 words)\n- \"contents under pressure\" (3 words)\n- \"doors closing\" (2 words)\n- \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words)\n- \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\n- \"low memory warning\" (3 words)\n- \"watch your step\" (3 words)\n- \"heads up, incoming!\" (2 words + 1 word, but separated by comma)\n- \"that was close\" (3 words)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words)\n- \"extra time added\" (3 words)\n- \"room twelve ready\" (3 words)\n- \"phones on silent\" (3 words)\n- \"great work team\" (3 words)\n- \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- \"start trail here\" (3 words)\n- \"window sensor fault\" (3 words)\n- \"runners take positions\" (3 words)\n- \"let dough rest\" (3 words)\n- \"back in 5\" (3 words)\n- \"clear the area\" (3 words)\n- \"paint this wall\" (3 words)\n- \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words)\n- \"new friend request\" (3 words)\n- \"access denied today\" (3 words)\n- \"update available now\" (3 words)\n- \"road work ahead\" (3 words)\n- \"battery critically low\" (3 words)\n- \"thread locked now\" (3 words)\n- \"who is there\" (3 words)\n\nAll are at least 2 words, most are 3.\n\nNow, False examples:\n- \"Delayed\" (1 word)\n- \"OK\" (1 word)\n- \"12:00\" (1 word)\n- \"R\" (1 word)\n- \"A1\" (1 word)\n- \"Sales\" (1 word)\n- \"8\" (1 word)\n- \"Exit\" (1 word)\n- \"CLIP\" (1 word)\n- \"root\" (1 word)\n- \"Queued\" (1 word)\n- \"AIR\" (1 word)\n- \"Start\" (1 word)\n- \"Eco\" (1 word)\n- \"WingB\" (1 word)\n- \"Holiday\" (1 word)\n- \"ugh\" (1 word)\n- \"LOCKED\" (1 word)\n- \"LTE\" (1 word)\n- \"Northwest\" (1 word)\n- \"37C\" (1 word)\n- \"y\" (1 word)\n- \"A5\" (1 word)\n- \"Blue\" (1 word)\n- \"Closed\" (1 word)\n- \"Home\" (1 word)\n- \"Paused\" (1 word)\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\nNow, let's check the new example:\n- The alert banner said \"Warning!\".\n  - \"Warning!\" is a single word, so it should be False.\n\nThis matches the classification.\n\n### Step 5: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\nAssume the quoted text is always in double quotes.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers/apostrophes)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

rule\n\nLooking at the quoted strings, the True examples are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), while the False examples are all single words or acronyms, or at most one word.\n\nLet's check

False examples are often single words, abbreviations, or very short phrases.\n2. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted text is usually three or more words. False examples are often one word, sometimes two, rarely three.\n3. **Case**: False examples often have the quoted text in all caps or title case, but True examples are usually in lowercase or sentence case.\n4. **Nature of Quoted Text**: True examples are more like instructions, notifications, or statements, while False examples are labels, statuses, or single words.\n\n#### Let's check the word count in the quoted text for True examples:\n- \"bears active today\" (3)\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (2)\n- \"update available now\" (3)\n- \"great work team\" (3)\n- \"let dough rest\" (3)\n- \"see you soon\" (3)\n- \"sold out now\" (3)\n- \"early bird yoga\" (3)\n- \"stay very still\" (3)\n- \"defense get back\" (3)\n- \"annual budget summary\" (3)\n- \"paint this wall\" (3)\n- \"matinee starts early\" (3)\n- \"motion withdrawn today\" (3)\n- \"access level mismatch\" (3)\n- \"processing your request\" (3)\n- \"call for details\" (3)\n- \"new business\" (2)\n- \"seat change requested\" (3)\n- \"doors closing\" (2)\n- \"low memory warning\" (3)\n- \"meeting moved\" (2)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (3)\n- \"clear the area\" (3)\n- \"take your card\" (3)\n- \"road work ahead\" (3)\n- \"package at reception\" (3)\n- \"contents under pressure\" (3)\n- \"do not disturb\" (3)\n- \"that was close\" (3)\n\nSo, most True examples have at least three words in the quoted text, but a few have two (\"thunderstorm watch\", \"new business\", \"doors closing\", \"meeting moved\").\n\n#### Let's check the False examples:\n- \"Login\" (1)\n- \"OFF\" (1)\n- \"Password\" (1)\n- \"URGENT\" (1)\n- \"Meeting\" (1)\n- \"EXIT\" (1)\n- \"Sales\" (1)\n- \"2\" (1)\n- \"Start\" (1)\n- \"Error404\" (1)\n- \"Armed\" (1)\n- \"4K\" (1)\n- \"Northwest\" (1)\n- \"R\" (1)\n- \"CLOSE\" (1)\n- \"No.7\" (1)\n- \"OPEN\" (1)\n- \"ugh\" (1)\n- \"HALFTIME\" (1)\n- \"Paused\" (1)\n- \"Closed\" (1)\n- \"GA\" (1)\n- \"FRAGILE\" (1)\n- \"WingB\" (1)\n- \"Eco\" (1)\n- \"Warning!\" (1)\n- \"Insert\" (1)\n- \"Blue\" (1)\n- \"North\" (1)\n- \"Tue\" (1)\n\nAll are one word.\n\n#### The new example:\n- \"Syncing\" (1 word)\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nBut some True examples have only two words (\"thunderstorm watch\", \"new business\", \"doors closing\", \"meeting moved\"), so the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

True examples have quoted text that is usually more than one word, often a phrase or a sentence fragment.\n   - False examples often have a single word or a code (\"Mute\", \"FRAGILE\", \"OPEN\", \"Success\", \"Sales\", \"Warning!\", \"ASAP\", \"VIP\", \"WingB\", \"CLIP\", \"SALE\", \"12:00\", \"HOT\", \"North\", \"OK\", \"Error404\", \"Draft\", \"LowBattery\", \"Charging\", \"Meeting\", \"Delayed\", \"MVP\", \"notes.txt\", \"Closed\", \"Idea\", \"STAFF\", \"A1\", \"B-12\").\n\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**:\n   - True examples: The quoted text is a phrase, often with at least two words, sometimes more, and often in lowercase (not all uppercase).\n   - False examples: The quoted text is a single word, code, or acronym, often in uppercase or title case, sometimes a number or code.\n\n3. **Capitalization**:\n   - Many False examples are all uppercase or title case, or a code/number.\n   - True examples are mostly lowercase phrases.\n\n4. **Rule Hypothesis**:\n   - The rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space), and not be a code, acronym, or single word.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"B-12\" (False): single code, no space.\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True): multiple words, has spaces.\n- \"do not disturb\" (True): multiple words, has spaces.\n- \"FRAGILE\" (False): single word, all uppercase.\n- \"update available now\" (True): multiple words, has spaces.\n- \"OK\" (False): single word.\n\n### Python Function\n\nSo, the function should check if the quoted text contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n#### Extracting the quoted text\n\nWe need to extract the text between the first pair of double quotes.\n\n#### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The app banner showed \"premium trial extended\" this week.\n- They chanted \"no more delays\" outside city hall.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns in False examples\n\nFalse examples:\n- The train display said \"Delayed\".\n- The oven display showed \"HOT\".\n- The necklace charm read \"hope\".\n- The tab title changed to \"Draft\".\n- The bench plaque said \"1998\".\n- The badge reads \"STAFF\".\n- The receipt printed \"PAID\".\n- The sticker read \"Caution\" on the ladder.\n- The runway sign showed \"A5\".\n- The headset reported \"Mute\".\n- The

Step 3: Compare the quoted strings\n\nLet's look at the quoted strings in True examples:\n- \"take your card\"\n- \"access level mismatch\"\n- \"extra time added\"\n- \"stay very still\"\n- \"ferry delayed again\"\n- \"exam starts promptly\"\n- \"clear the area\"\n- \"share your ideas\"\n- \"disk nearly full\"\n- \"two for one\"\n- \"no known allergies\"\n- \"engine temperature high\"\n- \"that

\"Silver\"\n- \"Paused\"\n- \"Closed\"\n- \"Master\"\n- \"37C\"\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nLooking at the quoted strings, the True examples are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), while the False examples are all single words, numbers, or codes.\n\nFor example:\n- \"take your card\" (3 words) -> True\n- \"Delayed\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"A1\" (code) -> False\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Step 5: Test the hypothesis\n\nTest with edge cases:\n- \"two for one\" (3 words) -> True\n- \"no more delays\" (3 words) -> True\n- \"no known allergies\" (3 words) -> True\n- \"Paused\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"LOCKED\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"A1\" (code) -> False\n\nThis fits.\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n### Step 7: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not match:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = match.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return

floor.\n- The tiny display blinked \"8\".\n- The storefront banner read \"SALE\".\n\nStep 3: Compare the quoted text in True vs False.\n\n- In \"True\" examples, the quoted text is always a phrase of at least two words, often a command, status, or message, sometimes a noun phrase, but always more than one word.\n- In \"False\" examples, the quoted text is always a single word, acronym, or very short (e.g., \"Idea\", \"AJ\", \"WPS\", \"STAFF\", \"Charging\", \"2\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"Insert\", \"Tue\", \"Queued\", \"Meeting\", \"Draft\", \"Silver\", \"EarlGrey\", \"AIR\", \"WingB\", \"MVP\", \"Closed\", \"R\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Boarding\", \"notes.txt\", \"Sales\", \"OFF\", \"37C\", \"Done\", \"Offline\", \"Perishable\", \"X\", \"8\", \"SALE\").\n\nStep 4: Check for exceptions.\n\n- All \"True\" examples have quoted text with at least two words.\n- All \"False\" examples have quoted text with only one word or a non-space string.\n\nStep 5: Formulate the rule.\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text (the text inside quotation marks) must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nStep 6: Write the function.\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\nStep 7: Write the JSON.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not match:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = match.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function extracts the first quoted string and returns True if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not match:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = match.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}"

All examples are of the form: \nThe [object] [verb] \"[text]\" [context].\n\n#### 2. The quoted text\n- In True examples, the quoted text is often a phrase, not a single word.\n- In False examples, the quoted text is often a single word or a short code (e.g., \"LOCKED\", \"VIP\", \"Holiday\", \"notes.txt\", \"Denied\", \"ugh\", \"X\", \"ON\", \"CLIP\", \"Queued\", \"SALE\", \"AIR\", \"Exit\", \"Master\", \"Login\", \"Start\", \"North\", \"FRAGILE\", \"B-12\", \"ASAP\", \"Draft\", \"Password\", \"Idea\", \"Blue\").\n\n#### 3.

The quoted text is never a single word or a single number.\n\nFalse examples: The quoted text is always a single word, a number, or a very short phrase (often one word, sometimes two, but never a full phrase or instruction). Examples: \"1998\", \"Password\", \"Soon\", \"ASAP\", \"Silver\", \"Syncing\", \"Student\", \"No.7\", \"4K\", \"X\", \"Tue\", \"Sales\", \"Open\", \"Closed\", \"Home\", \"PAID\", \"Bake\", \"Welcome\", \"LOCKED\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"12:00\", \"Perishable\", \"Boarding\", \"MVP\", \"HALFTIME\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Done\", \"root\", \"A12\", \"Northwest\", \"Exit\", \"hope\", \"Insert\", \"Login\", \"y\", \"Open\".\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nIt appears that the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check this:\n\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words), \"start trail here\" (3), \"meeting moved\" to Thursday (2, but with context), \"thread locked now\" (3), \"invoice overdue notice\" (3), \"double feature tonight\" (3), \"matinee starts early\" (3), \"family letters 1984\" (3), \"two for one\" (3), \"keep back clear\" (3), \"best coffee here\" (3), \"low memory warning\" (3), \"fresh eggs daily\" (3), \"milk almost gone\" (3), \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3), \"access denied today\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"winter clothes 2019\" (3), \"all aboard now\" (3), \"maintenance in progress\" (3), \"share your ideas\" (3), \"great work team\" (3), \"stay very still\" (3), \"see you soon\" (3), \"bears active today\" (3), \"tap card here\" (3), \"that was close\" (3), \"home team wins\" (3).\n\n- False: \"1998\" (1), \"Password\" (1), \"Soon\" (1), \"ASAP\" (1), \"Silver\" (1), \"Syncing\" (1), \"Student\" (1), \"No.7\" (1), \"4K\" (1), \"X\" (1), \"Tue\" (1), \"Sales\" (1), \"Open\" (1), \"Closed\" (1), \"Home\" (1), \"PAID\" (1), \"Bake\" (1), \"Welcome\" (1), \"LOCKED\" (1), \"SOLDOUT\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"Perishable\" (1), \"Boarding\" (1), \"MVP\" (1), \"HALFTIME\" (1), \"FRAGILE\" (1), \"Done\" (1), \"root\" (1), \"A12\" (1), \"Northwest\" (1), \"Exit\" (1), \"hope\" (1), \"Insert\" (1), \"Login\" (1), \"y\" (1), \"Open\" (1).\n\nThere are a few True examples where the quoted text is only two words, e.g., \"meeting moved\", but in those cases, the context adds a time or place (\"to Thursday\"). But in the quoted text itself, it's always at least three words.\n\n### Step 5: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least three words.\n\n#### Extracting quoted text\n\nThe quoted text is always in double quotes (\"...\"). So we can use a regex to extract the first occurrence of text between double quotes.\n\n#### Counting words\n\nWe can split the quoted text on whitespace and count the number of words.\n\n#### Function\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\n    return len(words) >= 3\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) >= 3\"\n}\n```"

**Lexical Properties**: True examples' quoted text often contains at least two words, sometimes more, and rarely (if ever) is a single word.\n4. **False Examples**: The quoted text is often a single word, a code, or a very short phrase (e.g., \"Start\", \"Open\", \"A5\", \"Done\", \"Home\", \"AIR\", \"ON\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Soon\", \"12:00\", \"HDR\", \"WingB\", \"Tue\", \"FRAGILE\", \"No.7\",

False examples are often a single word or a short code.\n\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often have quoted text that is a phrase, instruction, or message, not just a label, code, or single word.\n\n3. **Case Sensitivity**: Many False examples are all uppercase or single capitalized words (\"EXIT\", \"GA\", \"MVP\", \"CLOSE\", \"Eco\", \"OPEN\", \"HALFTIME\", \"2\", \"SALE\"). True examples are often lowercase or mixed case, and are more like natural language.\n\n4. **Number of Words**: True examples often have more than one word in the quoted text.\n\n5. **Lexical Properties**: True examples' quoted text often contains at least one space (i.e., more than one word).\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space character inside the quotes).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\n- \"heads up, incoming!\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"new business\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"contents under pressure\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"do not disturb\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"access level mismatch\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"fresh hot bread\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"markets in turmoil\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"phones on silent\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"card reader error\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"start trail here\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"helmets on now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"chef's special tonight\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"once upon a time\" (True) \u2192 4 words\n- \"road work ahead\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"take your card\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"early bird yoga\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"paint this wall\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"seat change requested\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"invoice overdue notice\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"update available now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"low memory warning\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"room twelve ready\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"maintenance in progress\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"access denied today\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"no more delays\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"payment received\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"community cleanup Saturday\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"please knock\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"all aboard now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"prepare for landing\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"premium trial extended\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"off duty now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"12:45\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Open\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"North\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"12:00\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Holiday\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"LowBattery\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"OK\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Login\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Update\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"GA\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Password\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"EXIT\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"AJ\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Meeting\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Perishable\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"1-0\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Boarding\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"MVP\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"CLOSE\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Exit\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"8\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"HDR\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ugh\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Eco\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"OPEN\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"HALFTIME\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"2\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"SALE\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space character inside the quotes).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.

True examples have the quoted text in all lowercase, or at least the first word is lowercase.\n2. **Length**: False examples often have a single word or a very short phrase.

(Classified as False)\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Quotation Content**: All examples have a quoted string. Both True and False examples have this.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: In True examples, the quoted string is almost always more than one word. In False examples, the quoted string is often a single word or a very short phrase.\n3. **Quoted String Case**: In False examples, the quoted string is often a single capitalized word (\"URGENT\", \"Student\", \"2\", \"LOCKED\", \"Master\", \"Armed\", \"Home\", \"Offline\", \"Password\", \"OPEN\", \"No.7\", \"FRAGILE\", \"AIR\", \"12:45\", \"Odyssey\", \"Login\", \"Mom\", \"A12\", \"OK\", \"8\", \"Soon\", \"GO\", \"Ready\", \"SOLDOUT\"). In True examples, the quoted string is usually a phrase, often with at least two words, and not all uppercase.\n4. **Quoted String Word Count**: It seems that if the quoted string is a single word, the example is False. If the quoted string is a phrase (two or more words), the example is True.\n\n#### Test this hypothesis:\n- \"The tab title changed to 'Draft'.\" (False) \u2014 single word.\n- \"The badge scanner shows 'access level mismatch' on error.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n- \"The vendor advertised 'fresh hot bread' every morning.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n- \"The envelope was stamped 'URGENT'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The recipe notes 'let dough rest' for ten minutes.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n- \"The ID card reads 'Student'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The news crawl read 'storm surge warning' along the bottom.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n- \"The key read 'Master'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The homepage banner said 'maintenance in progress' for hours.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n- \"The drone status reads 'Armed'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The map pin was labeled 'Home'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The icon tooltip showed 'Offline'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"My calendar has 'project final review' at 3 p.m.\" (True) \u2014 three words.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- \"The note read 'Soon'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The stage cue light showed 'GO'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The printer display read 'Ready'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n- \"The vending machine flashed 'SOLDOUT'.\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n\n#### Any True examples with a single word in quotes?\n- None.\n\n#### Any False examples with more than one word in quotes?\n- None.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Rule:** The text is True if and only if the quoted string contains at least two words.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that implements this rule. We need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Find the first pair of double quotes.\n2. Extract the string inside.\n3. Split it into words (using whitespace).\n4. Return True if there are at least two words, else False.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples have longer quoted strings, often more than one word. False examples are often a single word or a short phrase.\n3. **Structure**: True examples' quoted strings are often imperative phrases or statements, e.g., \"matinee starts early\", \"last train delayed\", \"comments temporarily closed\", \"paint this wall\", \"prepare for landing\", \"see you soon\", \"extra time added\".\n4. **False Examples**: The quoted strings are often single words or very short, e.g., \"A12\", \"Sales\", \"Eco\", \"STAFF\", \"Ready\", \"SALE\", \"HOT\", \"Open\", \"Home\", \"Offline\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"Bake\", \"Start\", \"A5\", \"Success\", \"Exit\", \"Idea\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Charging\", \"Closed\", \"A1\", \"4K\", \"Syncing\", \"X\", \"12:45\", \"OFF\".\n\n#### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words.\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"see you soon\" (3 words), \"open late\" (2 words), \"tap card here\" (3 words), \"no known allergies\" (3 words), \"extra time added\" (3 words).\n- False: \"Ready\" (1 word), \"SALE\" (1 word), \"Open\" (1 word), \"Home\" (1 word), \"Offline\" (1 word), \"Bake\" (1 word), \"Start\" (1 word), \"A5\" (1 word), \"Success\" (1 word), \"Exit\" (1 word), \"Idea\" (1 word), \"FRAGILE\" (1 word), \"Charging\" (1 word), \"Closed\" (1 word), \"A1\" (1 word), \"4K\" (1 word), \"Syncing\" (1 word), \"X\" (1 word), \"12:45\" (1 word), \"OFF\" (1 word).\n\nNo True example has a single-word quoted string.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- \"family letters 1984\" (3 words, True)\n- \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words, True)\n- \"chef's special tonight\" (3 words, True)\n- \"new friend request\" (3 words, True)\n- \"all aboard now\" (3 words, True)\n- \"open late\" (2 words, True)\n- \"tap card here\" (3 words, True)\n- \"no known allergies\" (3 words, True)\n- \"extra time added\" (3 words, True)\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted string and count the number of words.\n\nAssume the quoted string is always in double quotes.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers/apostrophes)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

examples:** The quoted string is always a phrase of at least two words, often a command, announcement, or message, but always more than a single word (with the exception of numbers or codes).\n3. **False examples:** The quoted string is a single word, a code, a number, or a short label (e.g., \"Odyssey\", \"WPS\", \"37C\", \"GA\", \"Charging\", \"Update\", \"A5\", \"Northwest\", \"Student\", \"Start\", \"North\", \"A1\", \"WingB\", \"URGENT\", \"1-0\", \"Bake\", \"HALFTIME\", \"LOCKED\", \"Open\", \"Warning!\", \"Holiday\", \"HDR\", \"Delayed\", \"ASAP\", \"ugh\", \"hope\").\n\n4. **True examples:** The quoted string is always at least two words, or a phrase that is not a code, number, or single word.\n\n5. **False examples:** The quoted string is a single word, code, or number.\n\n6. **Edge cases:** \"family letters 1984\" is True (contains a number, but is a phrase). \"project final review\" is True (three words). \"see you soon\" is True (three words). \"do not disturb\" is True (three words). \"paint this wall\" is True (three words). \"let dough rest\" is True (three words). \"phones on silent\" is True (three words). \"window sensor fault\" is True (three words). \"community cleanup Saturday\" is True (three words).\n\n7. **\"ugh\"** is False (single word, even though it's an utterance).\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space), and must not be a code, number, or single word.\n\nBut in the data, all True examples have at least two words in the quoted string, and all False examples are single words, codes, or numbers.\n\n### Implementation\n\nSo, the function should check if the quoted string contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n#### Extracting the quoted string\n\nWe need to extract the first quoted string (between double quotes) and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Python function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers separated by spaces)\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"',

(False): not a word, code.\n- \"1-0\" (False): not a word, code.\n- \"Syncing\" (False): one word, capitalized.\n- \"LowBattery\" (False): one word, camel case.\n- \"Insert\" (False): one word,

Rule\n\n- The quoted text must be at least two words.\n- All words must be lowercase (no uppercase letters).\n- No numbers, codes, or abbreviations.\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" (True) is only two words, both lowercase, so two words is sufficient.\n\n\"ugh\" (False) is one word, all lowercase, but only one word.\n\nSo the rule is: The quoted text must be at least two words, and all letters must be lowercase (no uppercase letters).\n\n### Step 4: Write the Python Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text, split it into words, check that there are at least two words, and that all letters are lowercase.\n\n#### Implementation Plan:\n- Use regex to extract the quoted text.\n- Split the quoted text into words (using regex to get only alphabetic words).\n- Check that there are at least two words.\n- Check that all letters in the quoted text are lowercase (ignore non-letter characters).\n\n### Step 5: Write the Function\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'[a-z]+', quoted)\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    return quoted == quoted.lower()\n```\n\n### Step 6: Return as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'[a-z]+', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    return quoted == quoted.lower()\"\n}\n```"

(I classified this as False.)\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. All the True examples have a quoted phrase that is at least two words long, often in lowercase, and often not a single word or a single number or a single label.\n2. The False examples are almost always a single word or a number, or a very short phrase (e.g., \"Delayed\", \"Open\", \"8\", \"GO\", \"Login\", \"Success\", \"Sales\", \"Draft\", \"ON\", \"OK\", \"Silver\", \"URGENT\", \"Mute\", \"Update\", \"Done\", \"OPEN\", \"AIR\", \"A1\", \"Welcome\").\n3. The True examples are always multi-word phrases, often in lowercase, and never all uppercase.\n4. The False examples are often all uppercase or title case, and are single words or very short.\n\nTesting this on the new example: \"CONFIDENTIAL\" is a single word, all uppercase, so it is False.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space), and must not be a single word or a single number.\n\nLet's write this as a Python function.\n\nFirst, extract the quoted phrase. Then, check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted phrase\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    phrase = m.group(1)\n    # Check if the phrase contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words)\n    return ' ' in phrase\n```\n\nNow, return the JSON:\n\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    phrase = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in phrase\"\n}"

always in lowercase (except for proper nouns or the first word, but in practice, all words are lowercase).\n- In False examples, the quoted text is a single word or a single number, or a single word with an initial capital letter, or all uppercase, or a single number, or a file name, or a single word with a capital letter.\n- In True examples, the quoted text is a phrase, not a single word, and is in all lowercase (except for possible proper nouns, but in practice, all words are lowercase).\n- In False examples, the quoted text is a single word, or a number, or a file name, or all uppercase, or capitalized.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text (the text inside quotation marks) must be a phrase of at least two words, and all words are lowercase (no uppercase letters).\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- True: \"no more delays\" (3 words, all lowercase)\n- True: \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words, all lowercase)\n- False: \"Syncing\" (1 word, capitalized)\n- False: \"STAFF\" (1 word, all uppercase)\n- False: \"12:45\" (number)\n- False: \"Charging\" (1 word, capitalized)\n- True: \"annual budget summary\" (3 words, all lowercase)\n- True: \"service begins\" (2

words, all lowercase)\n- False: \"Ready\" (1 word, capitalized)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words, all lowercase)\n\nThis fits.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"family letters 1984\" (contains a number, but is a phrase, so True)\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (contains a number, but is a phrase, so True)\n- \"once upon a time\" (all lowercase, phrase, True)\n- \"see you soon\" (all lowercase, phrase, True)\n- \"favorite summer city\" (all lowercase, phrase, True)\n- \"new business\" (all lowercase, phrase, True)\n\n### Rule in Python\n\nSo, the rule is: If the quoted text contains at least two words, and all alphabetic characters in the quoted text are lowercase, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted text (text between the first pair of double quotes).\n- Split the quoted text into words (using whitespace).\n- If there are at least two words, and all alphabetic characters are lowercase, return True.\n- Otherwise, return False.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check all alphabetic characters are lowercase\n    return all(c == c.lower() for c in quoted if c.isalpha())\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    return all(c == c.lower() for c in quoted if c.isalpha())\"\n}\n```"

Let's focus on the content inside the quotes.\n2. **True Examples**: The quoted content in True examples is always a phrase, often more than one word, and never a single word or a single number.\n3. **False Examples**: The quoted content is often a single word, a number, or a code (e.g., \"Error404\", \"37C\", \"1-0\", \"1998\", \"PAID\", \"STAFF\", \"Blue\", \"Done\", \"Mute\", \"Login\", \"Start\", \"Holiday\", \"SALE\", \"OPEN\", \"CLIP\", \"LTE\", \"Insert\", \"Student\", \"Perishable\", \"Password\", \"Draft\", \"EarlGrey\", \"notes.txt\", \"Restart\", \"Delayed\", \"y\").\n\n4. **Multi-word Phrases**: True examples' quoted content is always at least two words, and often a phrase that could be a sentence fragment or instruction.\n\n5. **Single-word or Code**: False examples' quoted content is a single word, a code, a number, or a short label.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: \"back in 5\" (True) is a phrase with a number, but not just a number. \"defense get back\" (True) is a phrase. \"group work rules\" (True) is a phrase. \"see you soon\" (True) is a phrase.\n\n7. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted content must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space), and not be a single word, code, or number.\n\n### Python Function\n\nSo, the function should extract the quoted content and check if it contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space, and both sides are alphabetic or alphanumeric words).\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n\n- Extract the quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split the quoted string into words (using whitespace).\n- If the number of words is at least 2, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- \"back in 5\" (True): 3 words, passes.\n- \"37C\" (False): 1 word, fails.\n- \"1-0\" (False): 1 word, fails.\n- \"Error404\" (False): 1 word, fails.\n- \"group work rules\" (True): 3 words, passes.\n\n### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

\"two for one\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"update available now\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"watch your step\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"prepare for landing\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"home team wins\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"share your ideas\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"extra time added\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"lifetime free updates\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"exam starts promptly\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"great work team\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"meeting moved\" (2 words) \u2190 exception\nTrue: \"window sensor fault\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"see you soon\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"off duty now\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"once upon a time\" (4 words)\nTrue: \"phones on silent\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"gate change incoming\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"open late\" (2 words) \u2190 exception\n\nFalse: \"Done\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Open\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"WPS\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"CLIP\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Northwest\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Silver\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"notes.txt\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"PAID\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Caution\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Ready\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"ugh\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Meeting\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"STAFF\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"SALE\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"root\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Mom\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Start\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"1998\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Eco\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"8\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"North\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"CLOSE\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"URGENT\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"No.7\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"GA\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Queued\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Welcome to the fair.\" (4 words, but has a period inside the quotes and is missing the closing quote)\nFalse: \"GO\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Closed\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"LowBattery\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Insert\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Draft\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"Exit\" (1 word)\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted phrase must contain at least three words.\n\nBut there are exceptions: \"meeting moved\" (2 words) is True, \"open late\" (2 words) is True.\n\nLet's check if the True examples ever have only one word: No.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words.\n\nBut then \"meeting moved\" and \"open late\" are True, but \"Welcome to the fair.\" is False (even though it has four words). But \"Welcome to the fair.\" is missing the closing quote, so maybe the rule is that the quoted phrase must be at least two words and the quotes must be balanced.\n\nLet's check the False example: \"Welcome to the fair.\" (missing closing quote).\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and the quotes must be balanced.\n\nLet's check the new example: The clerk stamped \"payment received\" on the invoice.\n\n\"payment received\" (2 words) \u2192 would be True by this rule, but the answer was False.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least three words.\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" (2 words) is True, \"open late\" (2 words) is True.\n\nIs there a pattern in the words themselves? Let's look at the False example: \"payment received\" (2 words) is False, but \"meeting moved\" (2 words) is True, \"open late\" (2 words) is True.\n\nIs there a pattern in the tense? \"meeting moved\" (past participle), \"open late\" (adjective + adverb), \"payment received\" (noun + past participle).\n\nIs there a pattern in the context? \"meeting moved\" is an alert, \"open late\" is a sign, \"payment received\" is a stamp.\n\nIs there a pattern in the first word? Let's check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least three words, or if two words, the second word is not \"received\".\n\nBut that seems ad hoc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least three words, or if two words, the phrase is not a common status or label.\n\nLooking at the False examples: \"payment received\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"PAID\", \"Ready\", \"Closed\", \"Insert\", \"Draft\", \"Exit\", \"Open\", \"CLIP\", \"WPS\", \"Eco\", \"Queued\", \"root\", \"Start\", \"CLOSE\", \"URGENT\", \"No.7\", \"GA\", \"LowBattery\", \"North\", \"STAFF\", \"SALE\", \"Meeting\", \"Mom\", \"Silver\", \"notes.txt\", \"1998\", \"8\", \"Caution\".\n\nThese are all status labels, not sentences or phrases.\n\nThe True examples are more like instructions, announcements, or sentences.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must be at least two words and not a status label or single word.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least one space and not be a single word, and not be a status label.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least three words.\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" and \"open late\" are exceptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a common status label.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a noun phrase.\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" is a noun phrase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a past participle phrase.\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" is a past participle phrase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase indicating a completed transaction.\n\n\"payment received\" is a completed transaction, \"meeting moved\" is a status update, \"open late\" is an announcement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase indicating a completed action.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase indicating a status.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase that could be used as a stamp or label.\n\n\"payment received\" is a stamp, \"meeting moved\" is not a stamp, \"open late\" is not a stamp.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase that could be used as a stamp or label.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase that is a status or label.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase that is a status or label, unless it is an instruction or announcement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words, and not be a phrase that is a status

Observations\n\n#### True Examples:\n- He whispered \"stay very still\" in the dark.\n- The banner at the station flashed \"last train delayed\" as commuters groaned.\n- The clinic sign says \"walk-ins welcome\" before noon.\n- The board lit up \"maintenance mode active\" unexpectedly.\n- The pamphlet promises \"lifetime free updates\" to members.\n- The pamphlet states \"call for details\" in small print.\n- A text appeared: \"low memory warning\" on the tablet.\n- The ATM screen displayed \"take your card\" with a beep.\n- The nurse called \"room twelve ready\" from the doorway.\n- The PA system blared \"doors closing\" before departure.\n- The homepage banner said \"maintenance in progress\" for hours.\n- The lab monitor displays \"sample processing complete\" soon.\n- My calendar has \"project final review\" at 3 p.m.\n- The attic box labeled \"winter clothes 2019\" fell apart.\n- The sign at the trail reads \"bears active today\" in fall.\n- The app banner showed \"premium trial extended\" this week.\n- The poster offered \"two for one\" on drinks.\n- They chanted \"no more delays\" outside city hall.\n- The conductor called \"all aboard now\" from the platform.\n- The fridge note read \"milk almost gone\" this morning.\n- The console displayed \"disk nearly full\" during backup.\n- The email subject read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The farm stand advertised \"fresh eggs daily\" with paint.\n- The checkout screen read \"tap card here\" politely.\n- A sticky note read \"back in 5\" on the monitor.\n- The program printed \"operation complete\" and exited.\n- The headline screamed \"markets in turmoil\" across the page.\n- The exhibit was labeled \"modern art wing\" by the entrance.\n- The megaphone blared \"clear the area\" near the site.\n- The call center recorded \"quality purposes only\" message.\n- The training video urges \"keep back clear\" of the machine.\n- The audit log shows \"access denied today\" at noon.\n\n#### False Examples:\n- The router lights flashed \"WPS\".\n- The cloud backup shows \"Queued\".\n- The graph title was \"Sales\".\n- A sticky note said \"ASAP\" and fell.\n- The envelope was stamped \"URGENT\".\n- The whiteboard corner said \"Idea\".\n- The speaker announced \"Boarding\" and stopped.\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The keychain was engraved \"AJ\".\n- The gym screen said \"Paused\".\n- The printer display read \"Ready\".\n- The system said \"Restart\".\n- The payment terminal reads \"Insert\".\n- The file was named \"notes.txt\".\n- The drone status reads

showed \"GO\".\n- The badge reads \"STAFF\".\n\n### Step-by-step deduction\n\n1. **All examples have a quoted string.**\n2. **True examples:** The quoted string is always more than one word, and is a phrase, not a single word or acronym.\n3. **False examples:** The quoted string is always a single word, acronym, or very short (e.g., \"WPS\", \"Queued\", \"Sales\", \"ASAP\", \"URGENT\", \"Idea\", \"Boarding\", \"WingB\", \"AJ\", \"Paused\", \"Ready\", \"Restart\", \"Insert\", \"Armed\", \"Warning!\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Odyssey\", \"y\", \"OPEN\", \"B-12\", \"Soon\", \"Student\", \"SALE\", \"Update\", \"GO\", \"STAFF\").\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: **The quoted string must contain more than one word.**\n\nLet's check for exceptions:\n- \"back in 5\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"project final review\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"disk nearly full\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"tap card here\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"operation complete\" (True) \u2014 2 words.\n- \"quality purposes only\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"keep back clear\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n- \"access denied today\" (True) \u2014 3 words.\n\nAll True examples have quoted strings with at least 2 words.\n\nAll False examples have quoted strings with only 1 word or an acronym.\n\n### Final Rule\n\n**A string is True if and only if the quoted string contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).**\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Count the number of words (split by whitespace).\n- Return True if there are at least 2 words.\n\nHere is the function in JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n

short phrase, often a label, a single word, a number, or a code (\"Odyssey\", \"EarlGrey\", \"1-0\", \"X\", \"CLOSE\", \"Delayed\", \"12:45\", \"Idle\", \"Northwest\", \"URGENT\", \"OPEN\", \"Sales\", \"No.7\", \"Charging\", \"Success\", \"Closed\", \"Bake\", \"OFF\", \"Mom\", \"HALFTIME\", \"Warning!\", \"CLIP\", \"root\", \"2\", \"Eco\", \"37C\", \"Error404\", \"Restart\", \"Open\").\n\nHypothesis:\n- The rule is about the quoted string: True if the quoted string contains at least two words (i.e., contains a space), False if it is a single word or code.\n\nTest this

Let's look at the content of the quotes.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings, often more than one word. False examples often have a single word or a short phrase.\n3. **Number of Words in Quotes**: Let's check if the True examples always have more than one word in the quotes.\n\n    - True: \"who is there\" (3), \"love over fear\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"low memory warning\" (3), \"no known allergies\" (3), \"new business\" (2), \"gate change incoming\" (3), \"please knock\" (2), \"sold out now\" (3), \"disk nearly full\" (3), \"free entry today\" (3), \"markets in turmoil\" (3), \"sample processing complete\" (3), \"open late\" (2), \"prepare for landing\" (3), \"card reader error\" (3), \"lifetime free updates\" (3), \"evacuate to lobby\" (3), \"seat change requested\" (3), \"wet surface ahead\" (3), \"best coffee here\" (3), \"comments temporarily closed\" (3), \"meeting moved\" (2), \"doors closing\" (2), \"off duty now\" (3), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"storm surge warning\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"update available now\" (3), \"call for details\" (3), \"service begins\" (2), \"invoice overdue notice\" (3), \"two for one\" (3), \"window sensor fault\" (3)\n    - False: \"ugh\" (1), \"Silver\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"AJ\" (1), \"Armed\" (1), \"SALE\" (1), \"Closed\" (1), \"WPS\" (1), \"Restart\" (1), \"Student\" (1), \"WingB\" (1), \"Paused\" (1), \"Open\" (1), \"8\" (1), \"Draft\" (1), \"SOLDOUT\" (1), \"VIP\" (1), \"Denied\" (1), \"Charging\" (1), \"Password\" (1), \"Welcome to the fair.\" (4, but ends with a period), \"Syncing\" (1), \"Northwest\" (1), \"Open\" (1), \"CLOSE\" (1), \"Holiday\" (1), \"12:45\" (1), \"R\" (1)\n\n    The only False example with more than one word is \"Welcome to the fair.\" but it ends with a period.\n\n4. **Punctuation in Quotes**: The only False example with more than one word in quotes is \"Welcome to the fair.\" (with a period at the end). All True examples' quoted strings do not end with punctuation (except possibly for \"service begins\" and \"meeting moved\", but those don't have punctuation).\n\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not end with punctuation (like a period).\n\n6. **Testing the new example**: \"Caution\" is a single word, so it is False.\n\n### Final Rule\n\n- Extract the quoted string.\n- If the quoted string contains at least two words and does not end with punctuation (., !, ?), return True.\n- Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Check for at least two words\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    # Check if ends with punctuation\n    if len(words) >= 2 and not re.search(r'[.!?]$', quoted):\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    if len(words) >= 2 and not re.search(r'[.!?]$', quoted):\\n        return True\\n    return False\"\n}\n```"

by the entrance.\n- The scoreboard flashed \"home team wins\" to the crowd.\n- The speaker concluded with \"thank you all\" to applause.\n- The clerk stamped \"payment received\" on the invoice.\n-

the password hint: \"favorite summer city\".\n- The ATM screen displayed \"take your card\" with a beep.\n- She muttered \"that was close\" under her breath.\n- The site banner announced \"comments temporarily closed\" today.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns in False examples\n\nFalse examples:\n- The car screen read \"Charging\".\n- The oven display showed \"HOT\".\n- The monitor corner showed \"HDR\".\n- The router lights flashed \"WPS\".\n- The label under the photo said \"Mom\".\n- The key read \"Master\".\n- The headset reported \"Mute\".\n- The badge scanner showed \"Denied\".\n- The

sticker read \"Caution\" on the ladder.\n- The wallet card said \"Silver\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare the quoted text in True and False examples\n\nLet's focus on the quoted text in each example.\n\nTrue examples (quoted text):\n- \"ferry delayed again\"\n- \"window sensor fault\"\n- \"modern art wing\"\n- \"home team wins\"\n- \"thank you all\"\n- \"payment received\"\n- \"helmets on now\"\n- \"family letters 1984\"\n- \"matinee starts early\"\n- \"package at reception\"\n- \"door left open\"\n- \"chef's special tonight\"\n- \"best coffee here\"\n- \"great work team\"\n- \"fresh hot

out now\"\n- \"bears active today\"\n- \"favorite summer city\"\n- \"take your card\"\n- \"that was close\"\n- \"comments temporarily closed\"\n\nFalse examples (quoted text):\n- \"Charging\"\n- \"HOT\"\n- \"HDR\"\n- \"WPS\"\n- \"Mom\"\n- \"Master\"\n- \"Mute\"\n- \"Denied\"\n- \"OPEN\"\n- \"SALE\"\n- \"Update\"\n- \"Delayed\"\n- \"North\"\n- \"Password\"\n- \"Open\"\n- \"8\"\n- \"Login\"\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\n- \"Eco\"\n- \"R\"\n- \"Success\"\n- \"Paused\"\n- \"1998\"\n- \"Perishable\"\n- \"Caution\"\n- \"Silver\"\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize rules\n\nObservations:\n- True examples: The quoted text is always more than one word (except \"meeting moved\", \"service begins\", \"great work team\", \"thank you all\", \"quiet on set\", \"keep back clear\", \"paint this wall\", \"take your card\", \"no known allergies\", \"favorite summer city\", \"operation complete\", \"engine temperature high\", \"access level mismatch\", \"comments temporarily closed\", \"sold out now\", \"bears active today\", \"extra time added\", \"package at reception\", \"door left open\", \"project final review\", \"family letters 1984\", \"matinee starts early\", \"modern art wing\", \"window sensor fault\", \"ferry delayed again\", \"home team wins\", \"payment received\", \"helmets on now\", \"best coffee here\", \"fresh hot bread\", \"chef's special tonight\", \"winter clothes 2019\", \"call for details\", \"quality purposes only\", \"service begins\", \"prepare for landing\", \"that was close\").\n- False examples: The quoted text is always a single word or a very short phrase, often a single word (\"Charging\", \"HOT\", \"HDR\", \"WPS\", \"Mom\", \"Master\", \"Mute\", \"Denied\", \"OPEN\", \"SALE\", \"Update\", \"Delayed\", \"North\", \"Password\", \"Open\", \"8\", \"Login\", \"Eco\", \"R\", \"Success\", \"Paused\", \"1998\", \"Perishable\", \"Caution\", \"Silver\").\n\nBut \"meeting moved\" (True) is two words, \"service begins\" (True) is two words, \"great work team\" (True) is three words, etc.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must be more than one word.\n\nBut let's check for exceptions. Are there any False examples with more than one word? No.\n\nAre there any True examples with only one word? No.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\n### Step 5: Test the rule on the new example\n\nNew text: The console status said \"Idle\".\n\nQuoted text: \"Idle\" (one word)\n\nAccording to the rule, this should be False, which matches the previous answer.\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nThe function should extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n### Step 7: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not match:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = match.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```\n"

examples are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), while the False examples are all single words or abbreviations, or very short (one word, or one word with punctuation).\n\nFor example:\n- \"Warning!\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"Northwest\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"LTE\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"Meeting\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"X\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"No.7\"

(False) \u2014 one word\n\nTrue examples are always at least two words:\n- \"access level mismatch\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"meeting moved\" \u2014 2 words\n- \"fragile items only\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"quality purposes only\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"that was close\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"milk almost gone\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"processing your request\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"paint this wall\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"seat change requested\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"comments temporarily closed\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"storm surge warning\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"no more delays\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"premium trial

\"payment received\" \u2014 2 words\n- \"modern art wing\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"two for one\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"best coffee here\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"family letters 1984\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"matinee starts early\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"contents under pressure\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"please knock\" \u2014 2 words\n- \"package at reception\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" \u2014 2 words (hyphenated word + word)\n- \"project final review\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"low memory warning\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"fresh hot bread\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"doors closing\" \u2014 2 words\n- \"let dough rest\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"watch your step\" \u2014 3 words\n- \"extra time added\" \u2014 3 words\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters/numbers separated by spaces).\n\n### Step 5: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\nAssume the quoted string is always in double quotes.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers/hyphens)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b[\\w-]+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b[\\\\w-]+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

All of these are at least two words.\n4. **False Examples with Multiple Words**: \"Welcome to the fair\" (False) is four words, but it is missing the closing quote (typo?). All other False examples are single words or codes.\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"EXIT\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Bake\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"LOCKED\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"EarlGrey\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"notes.txt\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Charging\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Update\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Mute\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Soon\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"ON\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"SALE\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"No.7\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"B-12\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Caution\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"HALFTIME\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Open\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"A12\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"2\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"Perishable\" (False): One word, no space.\n- \"North\" (False): One word, no space.\n\nAll True examples have at least two words in the quoted string.\n\n### Edge Case: \"Welcome to the fair.\"\n- This is False, but the quoted string is missing the closing quote. If we assume it's a typo and the quoted string is \"Welcome to the fair\", then it would be four words, but it's marked False. This could be an exception, or perhaps the rule is that the quoted string must have at least two words and not be a generic greeting or label.\n\nBut all other True examples are not generic greetings, but rather instructions, statuses, or messages.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have short, single-word or code-like strings.\n3. **Content**: True examples often look like natural language phrases or sentences, sometimes instructions, announcements, or status messages. False examples are often single words, codes, numbers, or very short phrases.\n4. **Word Count**: Let's check if the number of words in the quoted string is a factor.\n    - True: \"new business\" (2), \"package at reception\" (3), \"fresh hot bread\" (3), \"defense get back\" (3), \"update available now\" (3), \"bears active today\" (3), \"access level mismatch\" (3), \"start trail here\" (3), \"we are ready\" (3), \"fresh eggs daily\" (3), \"project final review\" (3), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"stay very still\" (3), \"quality purposes only\" (3), \"no more delays\" (3), \"open late\" (2), \"winter clothes 2019\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"family letters 1984\" (3), \"milk almost gone\" (3), \"payment received\" (2), \"card reader error\" (3), \"great work team\" (3), \"last train delayed\" (3), \"helmets on now\" (3), \"all aboard now\" (3), \"wet surface ahead\" (3), \"comments temporarily closed\" (3), \"extra time added\" (3), \"matinee starts early\" (3)\n    - False: \"notes.txt\" (1), \"HDR\" (1), \"Bake\" (1), \"8\" (1), \"ASAP\" (1), \"Welcome\" (1), \"OK\" (1), \"A5\" (1), \"B-12\" (1), \"12:45\" (1), \"Offline\" (1), \"1998\" (1), \"Meeting\" (1), \"GA\" (1), \"No.7\" (1), \"Queued\" (1), \"LOCKED\" (1), \"MVP\" (1), \"Welcome to the fair.\" (4), \"Odyssey\" (1), \"North\" (1), \"A1\" (1), \"HALFTIME\" (1), \"Armed\" (1), \"Insert\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"SALE\" (1), \"Mom\" (1), \"Sales\" (1), \"Ready\" (1), \"CONFIDENTIAL\" (1), \"A12\" (1), \"Draft\" (1)\n\n5. **Exceptions**: \"Welcome to the fair.\" is False, but has 4 words. But it ends with a period, which is rare in the True examples. \"payment received\" (2) is True, but \"Ready\" (1) is False.\n\n6. **Rule Hypothesis**: The quoted string must contain at least 2 words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n7. **Testing the Hypothesis**:\n    - All True examples have at least 2 words in the quoted string.\n    - All False examples have only one word, or in the case of \"Welcome to the fair.\", perhaps the period at the end disqualifies it.\n\n8. **Refinement**: Maybe the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not end with punctuation (like a period).\n\n9. **Testing \"Welcome to the fair.\"**: It is False, and ends with a period. All other True examples do not end with a period.\n\n10. **Final Rule**: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not end with a period.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function:\n\n- Extract the quoted string.\n- Check if it contains at least two words.\n- Check that it does not end with a period.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n\"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    if quoted.strip().endswith('.'):\\n        return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```\n"

Let's focus on the content inside the quotes.\n2. **True Examples**: The quoted strings in True examples are always multi-word, lowercase, and resemble natural phrases or sentences (e.g., \"thunderstorm watch\", \"exam starts promptly\", \"ferry delayed again\", \"who is there\", \"let dough rest\").\n3. **False Examples**: The quoted strings in False examples are often single words, acronyms, or capitalized words (e.g., \"LowBattery\", \"HOT\", \"Armed\", \"HALFTIME\", \"GA\", \"Success\", \"Northwest\", \"Start\", \"Paused\", \"WingB\", \"Bake\", \"Denied\", \"Student\", \"Welcome\", \"Open\", \"OFF\", \"Warning!\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Exit\", \"URGENT\", \"SALE\", \"Charging\", \"notes.txt\", \"y\").\n4. **Capitalization**: True examples' quoted strings are almost always all lowercase or mostly lowercase, and are at least two words. False examples are often single words, capitalized, or acronyms.\n5. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are at least two words.\n6. **Punctuation**: False examples sometimes have exclamation marks or are all uppercase.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must be at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (no uppercase letters except possibly for the first letter if it's a sentence, but in practice, all are lowercase).\n\nBut let's check for exceptions:\n- \"room twelve ready\" (all lowercase, three words)\n- \"favorite summer city\" (all lowercase, three words)\n- \"do not disturb\" (all lowercase, three words)\n- \"new friend request\" (all lowercase, three words)\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (all lowercase, two words, with a hyphen)\n- \"battery critically low\" (all lowercase, three words)\n- \"doors closing\" (all lowercase, two words)\n- \"new business\" (all lowercase, two words)\n- \"all aboard now\" (all lowercase, three words)\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"LowBattery\" (CamelCase, one word)\n- \"HOT\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"Armed\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"HALFTIME\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"GA\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"Success\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Northwest\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Start\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Paused\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"WingB\" (CamelCase, one word)\n- \"Bake\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Denied\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Student\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Welcome\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"Open\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"OFF\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"Warning!\" (capitalized, one word with punctuation)\n- \"FRAGILE\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"Exit\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"URGENT\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"SALE\" (all uppercase, one word)\n- \"Charging\" (capitalized, one word)\n- \"notes.txt\" (contains a period, one word)\n- \"y\" (one letter)\n\n### Rule\n\n**A string is True if the quoted text contains at least two words, and all the words are lowercase (allowing hyphens), and there are no uppercase letters.**\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted string.\n- Split into words (allowing hyphens).\n- Check that there are at least two words.\n- Check that all letters are lowercase (ignore punctuation and hyphens).\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Split into words (allow hyphens)\n    words = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z\\-]+', quoted)\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check all words are lowercase (allow hyphens)\n    return all(w == w.lower() for w in words)\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z\\\\-]+', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    return all(w == w.lower() for w in words)\"\n}\n```"

      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step to deduce the rule.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and False examples and see what distinguishes them.\n\n### Step 1: Look for patterns in True examples\n\nTrue examples:\n- The homepage banner said \"maintenance in progress\" for hours.\n- The door sign switched to \"please knock\" after hours.\n- The app banner showed \"premium trial extended\" this week.\n- The floor sign warns \"wet surface ahead\" beside the spill.\n- The megaphone blared \"clear the area\" near the site.\n- The event page marked \"sold out

noted \"no known allergies\" on the chart.\n- The message said \"package at reception\" upon arrival.\n- The weather app issued \"thunderstorm watch\" until 9.\n- The vendor advertised \"fresh hot bread\" every morning.\n- The announcer called \"runners take positions\" at the start.\n- The old marquee said \"double feature tonight\" downtown.\n- The headline screamed \"markets in turmoil\" across the page.\n- The email subject read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The site banner announced \"comments temporarily closed\" today.\n- The graffiti read \"love over fear\" beneath the bridge.\n- The farm stand advertised \"fresh eggs daily\" with paint.\n- The PA system blared \"doors closing\" before departure.\n- The clinic sign says \"walk-ins welcome\" before noon.\n- The scoreboard flashed \"home team wins\" to the crowd.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns in False examples\n\nFalse examples:\n- The vending machine flashed \"SOLDOUT\".\n- The backlit sign reads \"EXIT\".\n- The terminal prompted \"Login\".\n- The map pin was labeled \"Home\".\n- The thermometer read \"37C\".\n- The envelope was stamped \"URGENT\".\n- The backup finished with \"Success\".\n- The valve handle says \"CLOSE\".\n- The keychain was engraved \"AJ\".\n- The trophy base reads \"MVP\".\n- The tea tin was stamped \"EarlGrey\".\n- The printer display read \"Ready\".\n- The key read \"Master\".\n- The elevator panel reads \"2\".\n- A small tag said \"SALE\" in red.\n- The file was named \"notes.txt\".\n- The remote screen read \"4K\".\n- The wallet card said \"Silver\".\n- The stage cue light showed \"GO\".\n- The book spine read \"Odyssey\".\n- The poster says \"Welcome to the fair.\n- The kiosk shows \"Closed\".\n- The hatch was marked \"AIR\".\n- The drone status reads \"Armed\".\n- A sticky note said \"ASAP\" and fell.\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The watch face said \"Tue\".\n- The train display said \"Delayed\".\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The phone flashed \"LowBattery\".\n- The light above shows \"ON\".\n- The amplifier screen displayed \"CLIP\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare the quoted text\n\nLet's look at the quoted text in True and False examples.\n\nTrue (quoted text):\n- \"maintenance in progress\"\n- \"please knock\"\n- \"premium trial extended\"\n- \"wet surface ahead\"\n- \"clear the area\"\n- \"sold out now\"\n- \"free entry today\"\n- \"seat change requested\"\n- \"project final review\"\n- \"window sensor fault\"\n- \"winter clothes 2019\"\n- \"two for one\"\n- \"milk almost gone\"\n- \"processing your request\"\n- \"family letters 1984\"\n- \"open late\"\n- \"great work team\"\n- \"access denied today\"\n- \"update available now\"\n- \"no known allergies\"\n- \"package at reception\"\n- \"thunderstorm

fear\"\n- \"fresh eggs daily\"\n- \"doors closing\"\n- \"walk-ins welcome\"\n- \"home team wins\"\n\nFalse (quoted text):\n- \"SOLDOUT\"\n- \"EXIT\"\n- \"Login\"\n- \"Home\"\n- \"37C\"\n- \"URGENT\"\n- \"Success\"\n- \"CLOSE\"\n- \"AJ\"\n- \"MVP\"\n- \"EarlGrey\"\n- \"Ready\"\n- \"Master\"\n- \"2\"\n- \"SALE\"\n- \"notes.txt\"\n- \"4K\"\n- \"Silver\"\n- \"GO\"\n- \"Odyssey\"\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\n- \"Closed\"\n- \"AIR\"\n- \"Armed\"\n- \"ASAP\"\n- \"OK\"\n- \"Tue\"\n- \"Delayed\"\n- \"WingB\"\n- \"LowBattery\"\n- \"ON\"\n- \"CLIP\"\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nLooking at the quoted text, True examples are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), while False examples are all single words or single tokens (with the exception of \"Welcome to the fair.\", which is a False example, but it is missing the closing quote, possibly a typo).\n\nLet's check for exceptions:\n- All True examples: quoted text has at least two words (separated by spaces).\n- All False examples: quoted text is a single word or token (no spaces).\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the rule\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Step 6: Write the Python function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n### Step 7: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function extracts the first quoted string and returns True if it contains a space (i.e., at least two words), otherwise False."

Let's focus on the content inside the quotes.\n2. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are generally longer (multiple words), while False examples are often single words or very short (e.g., \"HDR\", \"A1\", \"Open\", \"Mom\", \"X\", \"2\", \"hope\", \"Update\", \"STAFF\", \"CLIP\", \"Login\", \"Offline\", \"SALE\", \"Perishable\", \"Holiday\", \"Welcome\", \"Master\", \"EarlGrey\").\n3. **Case**: False examples often have single words, sometimes capitalized, sometimes not. True examples' quoted strings are almost always two or more words.\n4. **Punctuation**: Not a clear pattern.\n5. **Numbers**: Some False examples are numbers (\"2\", \"8\", \"12:45\", \"A1\"), but not all.\n6. **Length**: The key seems to be the number of words in the quoted string.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\nLet's test this:\n- \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"maintenance mode active\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"helmets on now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"who is there\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"stay very still\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"road work ahead\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"tap card here\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"back in 5\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"off duty now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"update available now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"open late\" (2 words) \u2192 True\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"HDR\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A1\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Open\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Mom\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"X\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"hope\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Update\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"STAFF\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"2\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"EarlGrey\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n\nThis fits all the examples.\n\n### Python Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split it into words (by whitespace).\n- Return True if there are at least two words, else False.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    words = m.group(1).strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

All False examples have quoted phrases that are one or two words, or are not present at all.\n\nLet's check this:\n\nTrue:\n- \"access denied today\" (3 words)\n- \"matinee starts early\" (3)\n- \"ferry delayed again\" (3)\n- \"defense get back\" (3)\n- \"fragile items only\" (3)\n- \"evacuate to lobby\" (3)\n- \"project final review\" (3)\n- \"favorite summer city\" (3)\n- \"tap card here\" (3)\n- \"gate change incoming\" (3)\n- \"sample processing complete\" (3)\n- \"milk almost gone\" (3)\n- \"service begins\" (2) \u2190 exception?\n- \"markets in turmoil\" (3)\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (3)\n- \"once upon a time\" (4)\n- \"wet surface ahead\" (3)\n- \"room twelve ready\" (3)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (3)\n- \"all aboard now\" (3)\n- \"window sensor fault\" (3)\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (2) \u2190 exception?\n- \"thank you all\" (3)\n- \"seat change requested\" (3)\n- \"access level mismatch\" (3)\n- \"runners take positions\" (3)\n- \"update available now\" (3)\n- \"paint this wall\" (3)\n- \"who is there\" (3)\n\nFalse:\n- \"Tue\" (1)\n- \"root\" (1)\n- \"notes.txt\" (1)\n- \"A5\" (1)\n- \"y\" (1)\n- \"Draft\" (1)\n- \"Mom\" (1)\n- \"A1\" (1)\n- \"Home\" (1)\n- \"EXIT\" (1)\n- \"ON\" (1)\n- \"Meeting\" (1)\n- \"CLIP\" (1)\n- \"ASAP\" (1)\n- \"OFF\" (1)\n- \"Master\" (1)\n- \"OPEN\" (1)\n- \"Ready\" (1)\n- \"Denied\" (1)\n- \"AIR\" (1)\n- \"OK\" (1)\n- \"Northwest\" (1)\n- \"1998\" (1)\n- \"PAID\" (1)\n- \"Caution\" (1)\n- \"Armed\" (1)\n- \"SALE\" (1)\n- \"Syncing\" (1)\n- \"R\" (1)\n- \"STAFF\" (1)\n- \"Soon\" (1)\n- \"AJ\" (1)\n- \"Charging\" (1)\n\nBut there are some True examples with only two words in quotes: \"service begins\", \"walk-ins welcome\". Let's check if these are exceptions or if the rule is \"at least three words OR a hyphenated word\".\n\n\"walk-ins welcome\" contains a hyphenated word, which could be considered two words.\n\nBut \"service begins\" is just two words.\n\nIs there another pattern? Let's check the False examples for two-word phrases:\n\nNone of the False examples have two-word quoted phrases.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The text contains a quoted phrase of at least two words.\n\nLet's check for any False examples with two words in quotes.\n\nNone.\n\nSo, the rule is: The text contains a quoted phrase (delimited by double quotes) with at least two words.\n\nLet's check the new example: The intercom asked \"who is there\" at the gate.\n\n\"who is there\" = 3 words \u2192 True.\n\nSo, the function is:\n\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    matches = re.findall(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    return any(len(phrase.split()) >= 2 for phrase in matches)\n\nNow, let's return the JSON as requested.\n\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    matches = re.findall(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    return any(len(phrase.split()) >= 2 for phrase in matches)\"\n}"

False examples are often a single word or a short code.\n2. **Content of the Quoted Text**: True examples are often phrases or sentences, sometimes with multiple words, and often describe a state, instruction, or announcement. False examples are often single words, labels, or codes.\n3. **Lexical Properties**: True examples' quoted text often contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n4. **Testing the Hypothesis**: Let's check if all True examples have at least two words in the quoted text, and all False examples are single words or codes.\n\n#### Test on Examples\n\n- True: \"gate change incoming\" (3 words)\n- True: \"double feature tonight\" (3 words)\n- True: \"comments temporarily closed\" (3 words)\n- True: \"two for one\" (3 words)\n- True: \"window sensor fault\" (3 words)\n- True: \"exam starts promptly\" (3 words)\n- True: \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\n- True: \"storm surge warning\" (3 words)\n- True: \"off duty now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"room twelve ready\" (3 words)\n- True: \"paint this wall\" (3 words)\n- True: \"thunderstorm watch\" (2 words)\n- True: \"maintenance in progress\" (3 words)\n- True: \"no more delays\" (3 words)\n- True: \"runners take positions\" (3 words)\n- True: \"no known allergies\" (3 words)\n- True: \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words)\n- True: \"contents under pressure\" (3 words)\n- True: \"watch your step\" (3 words)\n- True: \"door left open\" (3 words)\n- True: \"operation complete\" (2 words)\n- True: \"motion withdrawn today\" (3 words)\n- True: \"let dough rest\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words)\n- True: \"thread locked now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"access level mismatch\" (3 words)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- True: \"road work ahead\" (3 words)\n- True: \"engine temperature high\" (3 words)\n- True: \"meeting moved\" (2 words)\n- True: \"heads up, incoming!\" (3 words)\n- True: \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words)\n- True: \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words)\n- True: \"new business\" (2 words)\n\n- False: \"Home\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Paused\" (1 word)\n- False: \"12:00\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Exit\" (1 word)\n- False: \"R\" (1 word)\n- False: \"37C\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Charging\" (1 word)\n- False: \"OFF\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Delayed\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Queued\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Insert\" (1 word)\n- False: \"CLIP\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Idle\" (1 word)\n- False: \"EXIT\" (1 word)\n- False: \"CLOSE\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Caution\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Odyssey\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Update\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Error404\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Tue\" (1 word)\n- False: \"root\" (1 word)\n- False: \"No.7\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Closed\" (1 word)\n- False: \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word)\n- False: \"A1\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Open\" (1 word)\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- True: \"thunderstorm watch\" (2 words)\n- True: \"operation complete\" (2 words)\n- True: \"meeting moved\" (2 words)\n- True: \"new business\" (2 words)\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: **The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).**\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted text and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Extract the quoted text (the string between the first pair of double quotes).\n2. Split the quoted text into words.\n3. Return True if there are at least 2 words, else False.\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

The difference seems to be in the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples have longer quoted strings, often more than one word. False examples often have a single word or a short code.\n3. **Case**: True examples' quoted strings are in lowercase or sentence case, often with multiple words. False examples are often single words, sometimes in all caps, or short codes.\n4. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are usually more than one word.\n5. **No Capitalization**: True examples rarely have all-caps or title-case single words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- True: \"disk nearly full\" (3 words)\n- True: \"no known allergies\" (3 words)\n- True: \"that was close\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Mom\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Update\" (1 word)\n- False: \"HALFTIME\" (1 word)\n- True: \"two for one\" (3 words)\n- True: \"winter clothes 2019\" (3 words)\n- False: \"North\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Draft\" (1 word)\n- True: \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words)\n- False: \"LOCKED\" (1 word)\n- True: \"free entry today\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Queued\" (1 word)\n- True: \"battery critically low\" (3 words)\n- True: \"favorite summer city\" (3 words)\n- True: \"start trail here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"early bird yoga\" (3 words)\n- False: \"12:00\" (1 word)\n- True: \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- True: \"lifetime free updates\" (3 words)\n- True: \"contents under pressure\" (3 words)\n- False: \"ugh\" (1 word)\n- True: \"room twelve ready\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Password\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Eco\" (1 word)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- True: \"modern art wing\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Sales\" (1 word)\n- True: \"all aboard now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"maintenance mode active\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Start\" (1 word)\n- True: \"prepare for landing\" (3 words)\n- True: \"low memory warning\" (3 words)\n- False: \"B-12\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Charging\" (1 word)\n- True: \"new business\" (2 words)\n- False: \"AIR\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Meeting\" (1 word)\n- False: \"OK\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Idea\" (1 word)\n- True: \"last train delayed\" (3 words)\n- False: \"12:45\" (1 word)\n- True: \"motion withdrawn today\" (3 words)\n- False: \"X\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Ready\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Odyssey\" (1 word)\n- True: \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words)\n- True: \"love over fear\" (3 words)\n- False: \"EXIT\" (1 word)\n- True: \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words)\n- False: \"OPEN\" (1 word)\n- True: \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words)\n- True: \"sold out now\" (3 words)\n- False: \"URGENT\" (1 word)\n- True: \"update available now\" (3 words)\n- True: \"keep back clear\" (3 words)\n- True: \"maintenance in progress\" (3 words)\n- True: \"matinee starts early\" (3 words)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.

words (sequences of letters, possibly including hyphens).\n\n#### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"',

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have single words or very short phrases.\n3. **Word Count**: Many True examples have quoted strings with three or more words. False examples often have one word, sometimes two, rarely more.\n4. **Lexical Content**: True examples often look like natural phrases, instructions, or sentences. False examples are often labels, statuses, or single words.\n5. **Capitalization**: False examples often have the quoted string in all caps or title case, but not always.\n6. **Punctuation**: Not a clear factor.\n7. **Specificity**: True examples are more descriptive or informative, while False examples are generic or categorical.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is likely: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- \"family letters 1984\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"free entry today\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"room twelve ready\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"favorite summer city\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"comments temporarily closed\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"thank you all\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"low memory warning\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"milk almost gone\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"processing your request\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"watch your step\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"paint this wall\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"contents under pressure\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"new business\" (2 words) \u2192 True (exception)\n- \"best coffee here\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"group work rules\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"keep back clear\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"who is there\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"clear the area\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"that was close\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"bears active today\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"update available now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"thread locked now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"exam starts promptly\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"stay very still\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"annual budget summary\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"we are ready\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"quality purposes only\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"off duty now\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"call for details\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"project final review\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"early bird yoga\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"two for one\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n\nNow, False examples:\n\n- \"Meeting\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Armed\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"OK\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Exit\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Perishable\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"CLOSE\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"OPEN\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"8\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Ready\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"VIP\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Insert\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A1\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"B-12\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A5\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Welcome\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"X\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Northwest\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"ON\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"AIR\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Paused\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Master\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A12\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Draft\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n\nThere are a few True examples with only two words, e.g., \"new business\", but this is rare and may be an exception or a mislabel.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.

In False examples, the quoted string is always a single word or a short code (e.g., \"VIP\", \"MVP\", \"B-12\", \"notes.txt\", \"Tue\", \"12:00\", \"Open\", \"LOCKED\", etc.).\n3. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain more than one word (i.e., at least two words).\n\nLet's check this hypothesis:\n\n- True: \"call for details\" (3 words), \"package at reception\" (3), \"once upon a time\" (4), \"premium trial extended\" (3), \"card reader error\" (3), \"early bird yoga\" (3), \"quality purposes only\" (3), \"thank you all\" (3), \"sample processing complete\" (3), \"invoice overdue notice\" (3), \"open late\" (2), \"room twelve ready\" (3), \"thread locked now\" (3), \"maintenance in progress\" (3), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"seat change requested\" (3), \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3), \"meeting moved\" (2), \"fresh eggs daily\" (3), \"best coffee here\" (3), \"exam starts promptly\" (3), \"great work team\" (3), \"comments temporarily closed\" (3), \"that was close\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"double feature tonight\" (3), \"doors closing\" (2), \"no known allergies\" (3).\n\n- False: \"Restart\" (1), \"notes.txt\" (1), \"HDR\" (1), \"Password\" (1), \"VIP\" (1), \"Meeting\" (1), \"HOT\" (1), \"Mom\" (1), \"B-12\" (1), \"MVP\" (1), \"SALE\" (1), \"Start\" (1), \"Warning!\" (1), \"12:45\" (1), \"OPEN\" (1), \"Armed\" (1), \"root\" (1), \"X\" (1), \"Idea\" (1), \"Update\" (1), \"OFF\" (1), \"STAFF\" (1), \"Blue\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"Tue\" (1), \"Open\" (1), \"Insert\" (1), \"WPS\" (1), \"Mute\" (1), \"ASAP\" (1), \"Sales\" (1), \"ugh\" (1), \"Open\" (1), \"HALFTIME\" (1), \"LOCKED\" (1).\n\nThis matches perfectly.\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n- Extract the quoted string.\n- Split it into words (using whitespace).\n- If the number of words is at least 2, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function as required.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Final JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

In \"False\" examples, the quoted text is often a single word or a code-like string (e.g., \"CLOSE\", \"X\", \"Queued\", \"Sales\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Password\", \"LowBattery\", \"A12\", \"Silver\", \"SALE\", \"Draft\", \"Paused\", \"Mom\", \"PAID\", \"2\", \"GA\", \"SALE\", \"Exit\", \"LTE\", \"Idle\").\n\n2. **Length of Quoted Text**: \"True\" examples have quoted text with multiple words (at least two), while \"False\" examples often have only one word or a code.\n\n3. **Lexical Content**: \"False\" examples often have quoted text that is a single word, an acronym, or a code (all caps, or a single word). \"True\" examples have quoted text that is a phrase, often with at least two words, and not all uppercase.\n\n4. **Case Sensitivity**: \"False\" examples often have all uppercase quoted text, or a single capitalized word. \"True\" examples have quoted text in sentence case or lower case, and with multiple words.\n\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The text is \"True\" if the quoted text contains at least two words (i.e., contains a space), and is not a single word or code.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"The valve handle says 'CLOSE'.\" \u2192 One word, all caps \u2192 False\n- \"The menu highlighted 'chef's special tonight' near the top.\" \u2192 Multiple words \u2192 True\n- \"The vending machine flashed 'SOLDOUT'.\" \u2192 One word, all caps \u2192 False\n- \"The sticky note read 'back in 5' on the monitor.\" \u2192 Multiple words \u2192 True\n- \"The poster offered 'two for one' on drinks.\" \u2192 Multiple words \u2192 True\n- \"The receipt printed 'PAID'.\" \u2192 One word, all caps \u2192 False\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\n### Python Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space between non-space characters).\n\n#### Implementation\n\n- Use regex to extract the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split the quoted string into words (using whitespace).\n- Return True if there are at least two words, False otherwise.\n\n### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have short, single-word or two-word strings.\n3. **Word Count**: Let's check if the number of words in the quoted string is the key.\n    - False: \"12:45\" (1), \"1-0\" (1), \"SOLDOUT\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"Delayed\" (1), \"Login\" (1), \"OPEN\" (1), \"Tue\" (1), \"Mom\" (1), \"Success\" (1), \"SALE\" (1), \"HOT\" (1), \"Start\" (1), \"PAID\" (1), \"LowBattery\" (1), \"root\" (1), \"B-12\" (1), \"Syncing\" (1), \"HDR\" (1), \"Sales\" (1), \"OFF\" (1), \"CLOSE\" (1), \"Offline\" (1), \"Soon\" (1), \"Boarding\" (1), \"Welcome\" (1), \"WPS\" (1)\n    - True: \"payment received\" (2), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"keep back clear\" (3), \"please knock\" (2), \"who is there\" (3), \"project final review\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"take your card\" (3), \"package at reception\" (3), \"milk almost gone\" (3), \"evacuate to lobby\" (3), \"processing your request\" (3), \"battery critically low\" (3), \"do not disturb\" (3), \"extra time added\" (3), \"let dough rest\" (3), \"gate change incoming\" (3), \"tap card here\" (3), \"disk nearly full\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"helmets on now\" (3), \"modern art wing\" (3), \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3), \"exam starts promptly\" (3), \"prepare for landing\" (3), \"bears active today\" (3), \"great work team\" (3), \"last train delayed\" (3), \"thread locked now\" (3), \"seat change requested\" (3), \"family letters 1984\" (3), \"call for details\" (3), \"window sensor fault\" (3), \"favorite summer city\" (3), \"no known allergies\" (3)\n\n    It seems that all True examples have quoted strings with at least two words, and all False examples have only one word in the quoted string.\n\n4. **Exceptions**: Are there any True examples with only one word? No. Are there any False examples with two or more words? No.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted string and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split it into words (by whitespace).\n- Return True if there are at least two words, else False.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often one word, sometimes two.\n4. **Lexical Content**: True examples' quoted strings are more like phrases or sentences, not just labels or single words.\n5. **Case**: False examples often have quoted strings in all caps or title case, but True examples are often in lowercase or sentence case.\n6. **Specific Words**: No clear pattern on specific words, but True examples are more descriptive.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- \"access denied today\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"annual budget summary\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"share your ideas\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"contents under pressure\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"early bird yoga\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"clear the area\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"LTE\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Insert\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"MVP\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Delayed\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Sales\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Perishable\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"12:00\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Caution\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"B-12\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"LowBattery\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"WPS\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"HOT\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Login\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n\nThere are no True examples with less than three words in the quoted string.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least three words.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted string and checks if it contains at least three words.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 3\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 3\"\n}\n```"

In False examples, the quoted content is always a single word or a code, or a number, or an abbreviation.\n3. **Single-word vs Multi-word**: For example, \"Syncing\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Open\", \"No.7\", \"Welcome\", \"Update\", \"Meeting\", \"MVP\", \"Restart\", \"Charging\", \"B-12\", \"OK\", \"GO\", \"notes.txt\", \"Blue\", \"12:00\", \"Exit\", \"1-0\", \"Closed\", \"R\", \"LOCKED\", \"HOT\", \"Holiday\" are all single words or codes.\n4. **Multi-word**: \"once upon a time\", \"low memory warning\", \"call for details\", \"processing your request\", \"fresh eggs daily\", \"take your card\", etc., are all multi-word phrases.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The text is True if the quoted string contains more than one word (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"defense get back\" \u2192 True (multi-word)\n- \"new business\" \u2192 True (multi-word)\n- \"GO\" \u2192 False (single word)\n- \"OK\" \u2192 False (single word)\n- \"family letters 1984\" \u2192 True (multi-word)\n- \"notes.txt\" \u2192 False (single word, even though it has a dot)\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"No.7\" is False (single token, even with a dot)\n- \"12:00\" is False (single token, even with a colon)\n- \"B-12\" is False (single token, even with a dash)\n- \"group work rules\" \u2192 True (multi-word)\n\n### Final Rule\n\nIf the quoted string contains at least one space, return True.

True examples: The quoted string is usually more than one word, often a phrase or a sentence.\n   - False examples: The quoted string is often a single word or a very short phrase (e.g., \"SALE\", \"Ready\", \"A1\", \"VIP\", \"Open\", \"Soon\", \"X\", \"WingB\").\n\n3. **Case Sensitivity**:\n   - False examples often have the quoted string in all uppercase or title case (\"SALE\", \"FRAGILE\", \"URGENT\", \"CLIP\", \"HALFTIME\", \"OFF\", \"PAID\", \"Syncing\", \"Draft\", \"Idea\", \"Open\", \"Mom\", \"Offline\", \"Soon\", \"X\", \"WingB\").\n   - True examples have the quoted string in sentence case or lower case, and often contain multiple words.\n\n4. **Word Count**:\n   - True examples: The quoted string is usually three or more words.\n   - False examples: The quoted string is usually one word, sometimes two, rarely more.\n\n5. **Punctuation**:\n   - True examples: The quoted string sometimes contains punctuation (commas, exclamation marks, etc.).\n   - False examples: The quoted string is usually a single word or a code.\n\n6. **Content**:\n   - True examples: The quoted string is a phrase that could be a message, instruction, or announcement.\n   - False examples: The quoted string is a label, code, or single word.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: **The quoted string must contain at least three words.**\n\nLet's check this with a few examples:\n\n- True: \"heads up, incoming!\" (3 words)\n- True: \"take your card\" (3 words)\n- True: \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words)\n- True: \"new business\" (2 words) \u2190 This is a counterexample.\n- True: \"motion withdrawn today\" (3 words)\n- True: \"maintenance in progress\" (3 words)\n- True: \"card reader error\" (3 words)\n- True: \"love over fear\" (3 words)\n- True: \"bears active today\" (3 words)\n- True: \"watch your step\" (3 words)\n- True: \"door left open\" (3 words)\n- True: \"stay very still\" (3 words)\n- True: \"window sensor fault\" (3 words)\n- True: \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words)\n- True: \"group work rules\" (3 words)\n- True: \"runners take positions\" (3 words)\n- True: \"tap card here\" (3 words)\n- True: \"double feature tonight\" (3 words)\n- True: \"room twelve ready\" (3 words)\n- True: \"no known allergies\" (3 words)\n- True: \"payment received\" (2 words) \u2190 Another counterexample.\n- True: \"walk-ins welcome\" (2 words) \u2190 Another counterexample.\n- True: \"markets in turmoil\" (3 words)\n- True: \"once upon a time\" (4 words)\n- True: \"paint this wall\" (3 words)\n- True: \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- True: \"extra time added\" (3 words)\n- True: \"quiet on set\" (3 words)\n- True: \"call for details\" (3 words)\n- True: \"sold out now\" (3 words)\n\nBut \"new business\", \"payment received\", \"walk-ins welcome\" are True with only two words.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: **The quoted string must contain at least two words.**\n\nLet's check the False examples:\n\n- \"SALE\" (1 word)\n- \"Ready\" (1 word)\n- \"Northwest\" (1 word)\n- \"A1\" (1 word)\n- \"Denied\" (1 word)\n- \"y\" (1 word)\n- \"FRAGILE\" (1 word)\n- \"URGENT\" (1 word)\n- \"Caution\" (1 word)\n- \"CLIP\" (1 word)\n- \"2\" (1 word)\n- \"1-0\" (1 word)\n- \"hope\" (1 word)\n- \"R\" (1 word)\n- \"VIP\" (1 word)\n- \"LowBattery\" (1 word)\n- \"root\" (1 word)\n- \"B-12\" (1 word)\n- \"HALFTIME\" (1 word)\n- \"WPS\" (1 word)\n- \"OFF\" (1 word)\n- \"Draft\" (1 word)\n- \"Idea\" (1 word)\n- \"Open\" (1 word)\n- \"A12\" (1 word)\n- \"Mom\" (1 word)\n- \"Offline\" (1 word)\n- \"PAID\" (1 word)\n- \"Syncing\" (1 word)\n- \"Soon\" (1 word)\n- \"X\" (1 word)\n- \"WingB\" (1 word)\n\nAll are one word.\n\nSo, the rule is: **The quoted string must contain at least two words.**\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n2. Count the number of words in the quoted string.\n3. Return True if the count is at least 2, else False.\n\n#### Edge Cases:\n- Quoted string may contain punctuation.\n- Words are separated by spaces.\n\n### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequence of letters/numbers separated by spaces)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

(I classified as False.)\n\n### Step-by-step deduction\n\n1. **Length of Quoted Text**: True examples tend to have longer quoted texts, often more than one word. False examples are often single words or very short.\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often have quoted text that is a phrase or sentence, sometimes with at least two words, often with a space.\n3. **Capitalization**: False examples often have quoted text that is a single word, often capitalized or a label.\n4. **Lexical Content**: True examples' quoted text is more like a message, instruction, or phrase, not a label or single word.\n5. **Special Characters**: The new example \"Error404\" is a single word with a number, no spaces, and was classified as False.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space character inside the quotes).\n\nLet's check this against the examples:\n\n- True: \"that was close\" (3 words), \"take your card\" (3), \"best coffee here\" (3), \"defense get back\" (3), \"window sensor fault\" (3), \"comments temporarily closed\" (3), \"matinee starts early\" (3), \"fresh eggs daily\" (3), \"keep back clear\" (3), \"clear the area\" (3), \"exam starts promptly\" (3), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"paint this wall\" (3), \"tap card here\" (3), \"runners take positions\" (3), \"off duty now\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"who is there\" (3), \"modern art wing\" (3), \"update available now\" (3), \"no known allergies\" (3), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"heads up, incoming!\" (3), \"ferry delayed again\" (3), \"open late\" (2), \"new friend request\" (3), \"all aboard now\" (3), \"road work ahead\" (3), \"maintenance in progress\" (3).\n\n- False: \"SALE\" (1), \"Blue\" (1), \"Queued\" (1), \"Meeting\" (1), \"hope\" (1), \"EarlGrey\" (1), \"Syncing\" (1), \"CLOSE\" (1), \"12:00\" (1), \"Delayed\" (1), \"Holiday\" (1), \"Idea\" (1), \"FRAGILE\" (1), \"Exit\" (1), \"Welcome to the fair.\" (but this is a phrase, but maybe the period is the issue), \"ON\" (1), \"X\" (1), \"LTE\" (1), \"Bake\" (1), \"North\" (1), \"MVP\" (1), \"Start\" (1), \"37C\" (1), \"HALFTIME\" (1), \"Boarding\" (1), \"ugh\" (1), \"Mom\" (1), \"Charging\" (1), \"Odyssey\" (1), \"Paused\" (1), \"R\" (1), \"Error404\" (1).\n\nThe only possible exception is \"Welcome to the fair.\" but it is marked False, possibly because of the period at the end, or maybe because of the capitalization.\n\nBut overall, the rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted text (the first substring between double quotes).\n- Check if there is at least one space in the quoted text.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

So maybe the rule is \"at least two words\" (i.e., at least one space).\n\nBut then \"Password\" (False), \"PAID\" (False), \"EXIT\" (False), \"GO\" (False), \"Open\" (False), \"SALE\" (False), \"Meeting\" (False), \"12:45\" (False), \"Bake\" (False), \"Eco\" (False), \"4K\" (False), \"URGENT\" (False), \"R\" (False), \"B-12\" (False), \"hope\" (False), \"Syncing\" (False), \"Ready\" (False), \"CONFIDENTIAL\" (False), \"Tue\" (False), \"1998\" (False), \"A1\" (False), \"Silver\" (False), \"OK\" (False), \"STAFF\" (False), \"Success\" (False), \"Queued\" (False), \"Sales\" (False) \u2014 all one word.\n\nBut \"room twelve ready\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"new friend request\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"meeting moved\" (True): 1 space, 2 words.\n\n\"walk-ins welcome\" (True): 1 space, 2 words.\n\n\"doors closing\" (True): 1 space, 2 words.\n\n\"service begins\" (True): 1 space, 2 words.\n\n\"fragile items only\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"modern art wing\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"door left open\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"helmets on now\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"update available now\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"low memory warning\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"quality purposes only\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"take your card\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\n\"sold out now\" (True): 2 spaces, 3 words.\n\nSo, all True examples have at least two words (i.e., at least one space) in the quoted text.\n\nAll False examples have only one word, a code, or a number.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nIf the quoted text contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words), return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text from the string, and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n#### Example extraction\n\nGiven: The bedside clock blinked \"12:00\".\n\nWe need to extract \"12:00\" and check if it contains a space.\n\n#### Python function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often a single word or a very short phrase.\n\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often have quoted text that is a phrase or a sentence, sometimes with a verb or a clear instruction, or a status update. False examples are often just a label, a single word, or a name.\n\n3. **Grammatical Structure**: True examples often have at least two words in the quoted text, and often include articles (\"a\", \"the\"), pronouns, or verbs. False examples are often just a noun or a single word.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: Not a clear pattern; both True and False examples have quoted text without punctuation.\n\n5. **Lexical Properties**: The True examples' quoted text is at least two words, and not a single word or a code.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\n- \"group work rules\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"best coffee here\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"CONFIDENTIAL\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Home\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"off duty now\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"no known allergies\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"LowBattery\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Eco\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"do not disturb\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"free entry today\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"Success\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Queued\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ON\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"STAFF\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"phones on silent\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"project final review\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"notes.txt\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"A12\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"ugh\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"motion withdrawn today\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"two for one\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"service begins\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"Student\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"CLOSE\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Open\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Start\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Check if quoted text contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

updates\" to members.\n- The moderator posted \"thread locked now\" to the forum.\n- The intercom asked \"who is there\" at the gate.\n- The supervisor commented \"great work team\" at standup.\n- He shouted \"heads up, incoming!\" over the noise.\n- I remembered the password hint: \"favorite summer city\".\n- The message said \"package at reception\" upon arrival.\n- A sticky note read \"back in

word) \u2192 False\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nTo extract the quoted string, we can use a regex to find the first occurrence of text between double quotes.\n\nThen, we can check if the quoted string contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Step 7: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers separated by spaces)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function extracts the first quoted string and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

Rule\n\nThe quoted text must be at least two words, and all words must be lowercase (ignoring digits and punctuation).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\n- Extract the quoted text.\n- Split into words (ignore digits and punctuation).\n- If there are at least two words, and all words are lowercase (or digits), return True.\n\nLet's write the function.\n\n```python\ndef

True examples are often phrases, not single words.\n\n2. **Phrase vs. Single Word**: True examples are almost always multi-word phrases, often in lowercase or sentence case, and often resemble instructions, statements, or descriptions. False examples are often single words, codes, or labels.\n\n3. **Lowercase**: Many True examples are in all lowercase or mostly lowercase (\"do not disturb\", \"once upon a time\", \"battery critically low\", \"paint this wall\", \"quiet on set\", \"phones on silent\", \"project final review\", \"stay very still\", \"door left open\", \"bears active today\", \"new friend request\", \"tap card here\", \"evacuate to lobby\", \"family letters 1984\", \"start trail here\", \"service begins\", \"lifetime free updates\", \"seat change requested\", \"who is there\", \"defense get back\", \"favorite summer city\", \"processing your request\", \"thunderstorm watch\").\n\n4. **Length**: True examples are usually more than one word.\n\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted text must be a phrase (more than one word), and the first word is not capitalized (i.e., starts with a lowercase letter).\n\n6. **Testing the Rule**:\n   - \"do not disturb\" (True): all lowercase, multiple words.\n   - \"once upon a time\" (True): all lowercase, multiple words.\n   - \"battery critically low\" (True): all lowercase, multiple words.\n   - \"Armed\" (False): single word, capitalized.\n   - \"Paused\" (False): single word, capitalized.\n   - \"Error404\" (False): single word, capitalized.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - \"family letters 1984\" (True): multiple words, not all lowercase, but first word is lowercase.\n   - \"favorite summer city\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"group work rules\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"service begins\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"lifetime free updates\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"seat change requested\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"who is there\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"defense get back\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"processing your request\" (True): multiple words, first word lowercase.\n   - \"thunderstorm watch\" (True): two words, first word lowercase.\n\n   All True examples: quoted text is more than one word, and the first word is lowercase.\n\n   All False examples: quoted text is a single word, or the first word is capitalized.\n\n### Final Rule\n\n**The quoted text must be more than one word, and the first word must start with a lowercase letter.**\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted text, check if it has more than one word, and if the first word starts with a lowercase letter.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) > 1 and words[0][0].islower()\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) > 1 and words[0][0].islower()\"\n}\n```"

      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step to deduce the rule.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and False examples and see what distinguishes them.\n\n### Step 1: Compare True and False Examples\n\n#### True Examples (selected):\n- The email subject read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The tour guide said \"watch your step\" near the ruins.\n- The clinic sign says \"walk-ins welcome\" before noon.\n- The call center recorded \"quality purposes only\" message.\n- The scoreboard flashed \"home team wins\" to the crowd.\n- The booklet cover reads \"annual budget summary\" in blue.\n- The terminal printed \"seat change requested\" for me.\n- She muttered \"that was close\" under her breath.\n- The menu highlighted \"chef's special tonight\" near the top.\n- The line supervisor shouted \"helmets on now\" at the crew.\n- The students replied \"we are ready\" in unison.\n- The radio crackled \"evacuate to lobby\" during the drill.\n- The clerk stamped \"payment received\" on the invoice.\n- The teacher wrote \"group work rules\" on the board.\n- The alarm panel indicated \"window sensor fault\" briefly.\n- The traffic sign blinked \"road work ahead\" all week.\n- The chef announced \"service begins\" and clapped.\n- The board lit up \"maintenance mode active\" unexpectedly.\n- A sticky note read \"back in 5\" on the monitor.\n- He whispered \"stay very still\" in the dark.\n- The alert said \"battery critically low\" and shut down.\n- The dock display shows \"ferry delayed again\" today.\n- The speaker concluded with \"thank you all\" to applause.\n- The graffiti read \"love over fear\" beneath the bridge.\n- The guide wrote \"start trail here\" on the map.\n- The builder chalked \"paint this wall\" on the plaster.\n- The audit log shows \"access denied today\" at noon.\n- The event page marked \"sold out now\" overnight.\n- The door sticker says \"do not disturb\" in two languages.\n- The taxi's light read \"off duty now\" in red.\n- The attorney noted \"motion withdrawn today\" in the file.\n- The recipe notes \"let dough rest\" for ten minutes.\n\n#### False Examples (selected):\n- The badge reads \"STAFF\".\n- The poster says \"Welcome to the fair.\n- The box was stamped \"FRAGILE\" on top.\n- The tag reads \"Blue\".\n- The keypad flashed \"LOCKED\".\n- The monitor corner showed \"HDR\".\n- The wallet card said \"Silver\".\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The runway sign showed \"A5\".\n- The ticket says \"A1\".\n- The graph title was \"Sales\".\n- The scoreboard read \"1-0\".\n- The phone flashed \"LowBattery\".\n- The heater panel displayed \"Eco\".\n- The phone status showed \"LTE\".\n- The icon tooltip showed \"Offline\".\n- The system said \"Restart\".\n- The valve handle says \"CLOSE\".\n- The tea tin was stamped \"EarlGrey\".\n- The headset reported \"Mute\".\n- A sticky note said \"ASAP\" and fell.\n- The stadium board flashed \"HALFTIME\".\n\n### Step 2: Look for Patterns\n\n#### 1. Length of Quoted Text\n- True examples often have quoted text that is more than one word, often a phrase or a sentence.\n- False examples often have quoted text that is a single word or a very short phrase (often one word, sometimes two, but rarely more).\n\n#### 2. Content of Quoted Text\n- True examples: \"invoice overdue notice\", \"watch your step\", \"walk-ins welcome\", \"quality purposes only\", \"home team wins\", \"annual budget summary\", \"seat change requested\", \"that was close\", \"chef's special tonight\", \"helmets on now\", \"we are ready\", \"evacuate to lobby\", \"payment received\", \"group work rules\", \"window sensor fault\", \"road work ahead\", \"service begins\", \"maintenance mode active\", \"back in 5\", \"stay very still\", \"battery critically low\", \"ferry delayed again\", \"thank you all\", \"love over fear\", \"start trail here\", \"paint this wall\", \"access denied today\", \"sold out now\", \"do not disturb\", \"off duty now\", \"motion withdrawn today\", \"let dough rest\".\n- False examples: \"STAFF\", \"Welcome\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Blue\", \"LOCKED\", \"HDR\", \"Silver\", \"WingB\", \"A5\", \"A1\", \"Sales\", \"1-0\", \"LowBattery\", \"Eco\", \"LTE\", \"Offline\", \"Restart\", \"CLOSE\", \"EarlGrey\", \"Mute\", \"ASAP\", \"HALFTIME\".\n\n#### 3. Grammatical Structure\n- True examples: The quoted text is often a phrase or sentence, sometimes imperative or descriptive, sometimes a noun phrase.\n- False examples: The quoted text is often a single word, sometimes an all-caps label, or a code.\n\n#### 4. Case\n- False examples often have quoted text in all caps or title case, but not always.\n\n#### 5. Number of Words\n- Let's check: For True, the quoted text is almost always three or more words. For False, it's usually one word, sometimes two.\n\n#### 6. The New Example\n- The homepage banner said \"maintenance in progress\" for hours.\n- The quoted text is \"maintenance in progress\" (three words).\n\n### Step 3: Hypothesize the Rule\n\nIt seems the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"back in 5\" (3 words), \"we are ready\" (3), \"thank you all\" (3), \"off duty now\" (3), \"let dough rest\" (3), \"sold out now\" (3), \"do not disturb\" (3), \"group work rules\" (3), \"road work ahead\" (3), \"window sensor fault\" (3), \"home team wins\" (3), \"annual budget summary\" (3), \"quality purposes only\" (3), \"invoice overdue notice\" (3), \"chef's special tonight\" (3), \"start trail here\" (3), \"paint this wall\" (3), \"access denied today\" (3), \"motion withdrawn today\" (3), \"ferry delayed again\" (3), \"battery critically low\" (3), \"service begins\" (2), \"stay very still\" (3), \"that was close\" (3), \"helmets on now\" (3), \"walk-ins welcome\" (2), \"seat change requested\" (3), \"sold out now\" (3), \"maintenance mode active\" (3), \"love over fear\" (3), \"let dough rest\" (3).\n\nBut \"walk-ins welcome\" and \"service begins\" are only two words and are True.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\nLet's check False examples:\n- \"STAFF\" (1), \"Welcome\" (1), \"FRAGILE\" (1), \"Blue\" (1), \"LOCKED\" (1), \"HDR\" (1), \"Silver\" (1), \"WingB\" (1), \"A5\" (1), \"A1\" (1), \"Sales\" (1), \"1-0\" (1), \"LowBattery\" (1), \"Eco\" (1), \"LTE\" (1), \"Offline\" (1), \"Restart\" (1), \"CLOSE\" (1), \"EarlGrey\" (1), \"Mute\" (1), \"ASAP\" (1), \"HALFTIME\" (1).\n\nAre there any False examples with two or more words? No.\n\nAre there any True examples with only one word? No.\n\n### Step 4: Finalize the Rule\n\n**Rule:** The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\n### Step 5: Write the Python Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Implementation Plan\n- Use regex to extract the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split the quoted string into words (using whitespace).\n- Return True if the number of words is at least 2.\n\n### Step 6: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```\n"

True examples have quoted text that is longer, often more than one word, sometimes a phrase or a sentence.\n   - False examples often have a single word or a very short phrase in quotes.\n\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**:\n   - True examples: The quoted text is often an instruction, notification, or message that could be shown to a user, often in the imperative or as a status update.\n   - False examples: The quoted text is often a label, a single word, a status, or a title.\n\n3. **Lexical Properties**:\n   - True: Quoted text contains at least two words (i.e., contains a space).\n   - False: Quoted text is a single word or a code.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - \"back in 5\" (True): 3 words.\n   - \"new friend request\" (True): 3 words.\n   -

      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and False examples and try to find a pattern.\n\n### Observations\n\n#### True Examples:\n- The checkout screen read \"tap card here\" politely.\n- The builder chalked \"paint this wall\" on the plaster.\n- The taxi's light read \"off duty now\" in red.\n- The calendar alert said \"meeting moved\" to Thursday.\n- They chanted \"no more delays\" outside city hall.\n- The message said \"package at reception\" upon arrival.\n- The door sticker says \"do not disturb\" in two languages.\n- I remembered the password hint: \"favorite summer city\".\n- The booklet cover reads \"annual budget summary\" in blue.\n- The sign at the trail reads \"bears active today\" in fall.\n- The attic box labeled \"winter clothes 2019\" fell apart.\n- The board lit up \"maintenance mode active\" unexpectedly.\n- The theatre sign glowed \"matinee starts early\" at noon.\n- The alert said \"battery critically low\" and shut down.\n- The weather app issued \"thunderstorm watch\" until 9.\n- The tour guide said \"watch your step\" near the ruins.\n- The news crawl read \"storm surge warning\" along the bottom.\n- The graffiti read \"love over fear\" beneath the bridge.\n- The director yelled \"quiet on set\" before the take.\n- The headline screamed \"markets in turmoil\" across the page.\n- The noticeboard had \"community cleanup Saturday\" at noon.\n- The students replied \"we are ready\" in unison.\n- The audit log shows \"access denied today\" at noon.\n- The kiosk announced \"card reader error\" repeatedly.\n- The door sign switched to \"please knock\" after hours.\n- The event page marked \"sold out now\" overnight.\n- The guide wrote \"start trail here\" on the map.\n- The announcer called \"runners take positions\" at the start.\n- The exhibit was labeled \"modern art wing\" by the entrance.\n- The dock display shows \"ferry delayed again\" today.\n- The app flashed \"update available now\" during class.\n- The moderator posted \"thread locked now\" to the forum.\n\n#### False Examples:\n- The console printed \"Done\".\n- The ID card reads \"Student\".\n- The train display said \"Delayed\".\n- The wallet card said \"Silver\".\n- The remote screen read \"4K\".\n- The oven knob points to \"Bake\".\n- She muttered \"ugh\" and walked away.\n- The phone status showed \"LTE\".\n- The elevator panel reads \"2\".\n- The alert banner said \"Warning!\".\n- The chalk mark read \"X\" on the floor.\n- The campus kiosk displays \"Northwest\".\n- The lamps flickered in the wind.\n- The oven display showed \"HOT\".\n- He typed \"y\" and pressed enter.\n- The package says \"Perishable\".\n- The key read \"Master\".\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The backup finished with \"Success\".\n- The ticket stub says \"GA\".\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The console status said \"Idle\".\n- The gym screen said \"Paused\".\n- The subject line was \"Meeting\".\n- The backlit sign reads \"EXIT\".\n- The side door was labeled \"Exit\".\n- The drone status reads \"Armed\".\n- The icon tooltip showed \"Offline\".\n- The command line displayed \"root\".\n- The map pin was labeled \"Home\".\n\n#### The new example:\n- She muttered \"that was close\" under her breath. (Classified as False)\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Length of Quoted Text**: In True examples, the quoted text is often a phrase (multiple words), while in False examples, it's often a single word or very short phrase. But there are exceptions: \"we are ready\" (True), \"y\" (False), \"OK\" (False), \"Done\" (False), \"Student\" (False), \"Delayed\" (False), \"Silver\" (False), \"4K\" (False), \"Bake\" (False), \"ugh\" (False), \"LTE\" (False), \"2\" (False), \"Warning!\" (False), \"X\" (False), \"Northwest\" (False), \"HOT\" (False), \"Master\" (False), \"WingB\" (False), \"Success\" (False), \"GA\" (False), \"Idle\" (False), \"Paused\" (False), \"Meeting\" (False), \"EXIT\" (False), \"Exit\" (False), \"Armed\" (False), \"Offline\" (False), \"root\" (False), \"Home\" (False).\n\n2. **Quoted Text Contains Multiple Words**: All True examples have quoted text with at least two words. All False examples have quoted text with only one word or a non-phrase (except \"that was close\" in the new example, which is three words but was classified as False).\n\n3. **Quoted Text Structure**: In True examples, the quoted text is a phrase that could be a message, instruction, or announcement, often with at least three words. In False examples, the quoted text is a single word or a very short phrase.\n\n4. **Quoted Text Contains a Space**: All True examples' quoted text contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words). All False examples' quoted text does not contain a space (i.e., only one word), except for the new example \"that was close\", which was classified as False.\n\n5. **Quoted Text Contains a Verb**: In True examples, the quoted text often contains a verb (\"tap card here\", \"paint this wall\", \"off duty now\", \"meeting moved\", \"no more delays\", \"package at reception\", \"do not disturb\", \"favorite summer city\", \"annual budget summary\", \"bears active today\", \"winter clothes 2019\", \"maintenance mode active\", \"matinee starts early\", \"battery critically low\", \"thunderstorm watch\", \"watch your step\", \"storm surge warning\", \"love over fear\", \"quiet on set\", \"markets in turmoil\", \"community cleanup Saturday\", \"we are ready\", \"access denied today\", \"card reader error\", \"please knock\", \"sold out now\", \"start trail here\", \"runners take positions\", \"modern art wing\", \"ferry delayed again\", \"update available now\", \"thread locked now\").\n\nBut some True examples are just noun phrases (\"favorite summer city\", \"annual budget summary\", \"winter clothes 2019\", \"modern art wing\", \"community cleanup Saturday\").\n\n6. **Quoted Text is a Noun Phrase with at least Three Words**: All True examples' quoted text is at least three words, except \"we are ready\" (three words), \"off duty now\" (three words), \"no more delays\" (three words), \"do not disturb\" (three words), \"favorite summer city\" (three words), \"annual budget summary\" (three words), \"bears active today\" (three words), \"winter clothes 2019\" (three words), \"matinee starts early\" (three words), \"battery critically low\" (three words), \"thunderstorm watch\" (two words), \"watch your step\" (three words), \"storm surge warning\" (three words), \"love over fear\" (three words), \"quiet on set\" (three words), \"markets in turmoil\" (three words), \"community cleanup Saturday\" (three words), \"access denied today\" (three words), \"card reader error\" (three words), \"please knock\" (two words), \"sold out now\" (three words), \"start trail here\" (three words), \"runners take positions\" (three words), \"modern art wing\" (three words), \"ferry delayed again\" (three words), \"update available now\" (three words), \"thread locked now\" (three words).\n\nBut \"please knock\" and \"thunderstorm watch\" are only two words and are True.\n\n7. **Minimum Number of Words in Quoted Text**: It seems that all True examples have at least two words in the quoted text, and all False examples have only one word or a non-phrase. However, the new example \"that was close\" (three words) was classified as False.\n\n8. **Context**: In the new example, the context is \"She muttered ... under her breath.\" In all True examples, the context is a sign, message, announcement, label, etc. In False examples, the context is a person muttering, typing, or a status, label, or code.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must be at least two words, and the context must be an impersonal message, sign, label, or announcement, not a personal utterance or status.\n\nBut the rule must be string-based and not semantic.\n\n### Lexical Rule\n\nLooking at the string, all True examples' quoted text contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words), and the quoted text is all lowercase (except for proper nouns or the first word). But in False examples, the quoted text is often capitalized or a single word.\n\nBut \"that was close\" is three words, all lowercase, but was classified as False.\n\n### Final Hypothesis\n\nLooking at the context, all True examples have the quoted text immediately following a verb like \"said\", \"read\", \"announced\", \"posted\", \"shows\", \"marked\", \"labeled\", \"called\", \"wrote\", \"flashed\", \"issued\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\", \"replied\",

False examples are often a single word or a very short phrase.\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often contain phrases that are more like sentences or instructions, or at least multi-word phrases. False examples are often single words, numbers, or very short labels.\n3. **Presence of Spaces**: All True examples have at least one space in the quoted text. All False examples have quoted text with no spaces (single word or number), or a very short phrase (e.g., \"1-0\", \"4K\", \"A12\", \"EXIT\", \"GO\", \"Tue\", \"Mute\", \"Student\", \"North\", \"Paused\", \"Login\", \"Armed\", \"CLOSE\", \"SALE\", \"URGENT\", \"Perishable\", \"EarlGrey\", \"37C\", \"PAID\", \"Welcome\", \"HALFTIME\", \"Syncing\").\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least one space (i.e., be at least two words).\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True) \u2192 has spaces\n- \"access level mismatch\" (True) \u2192 has spaces\n- \"prepare for landing\" (True) \u2192 has spaces\n- \"Open\" (False) \u2192 no space\n- \"Tue\" (False) \u2192 no space\n- \"1-0\" (False) \u2192 no space\n- \"1998\" (False) \u2192 no space\n\nThis fits all the examples.\n\n### Python Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    return \" \" in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return \\\" \\\" in quoted\"\n}\n```"

      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step to deduce the rule.\n\nFirst, let's look for patterns in the True examples:\n\n- The program printed \"operation complete\" and exited.\n- The event page marked \"sold out now\" overnight.\n- The menu highlighted \"chef's special tonight\" near the top.\n- The board lit up \"maintenance mode active\" unexpectedly.\n- The announcer called \"runners take positions\" at the start.\n- The kiosk announced \"card reader error\" repeatedly.\n- The pilot announced \"prepare for landing\" calmly.\n- The coach barked \"defense get back\" after the turnover.\n- The email subject read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The banner at the station flashed \"last train delayed\" as commuters groaned.\n- The usher whispered \"phones on silent\" as we entered.\n- The tour guide said \"watch your step\" near the ruins.\n- The graffiti read \"love over fear\" beneath the bridge.\n- The call center recorded \"quality purposes only\" message.\n- I remembered the password hint: \"favorite summer city\".\n- The homepage banner said \"maintenance in progress\" for hours.\n- The moderator posted \"thread locked now\" to the forum.\n- The supervisor commented \"great work team\" at standup.\n- The alarm panel indicated \"window sensor fault\" briefly.\n- The pamphlet promises \"lifetime free updates\" to members.\n- The nurse noted \"no known allergies\" on the chart.\n- The app banner showed \"premium trial extended\" this week.\n- The agenda listed \"new business\" first.\n- The guide wrote \"start trail here\" on the map.\n- The flyer said \"free entry today\" in bold letters.\n- The nurse called \"room twelve ready\" from the doorway.\n- The lab monitor displays \"sample processing complete\" soon.\n- The noticeboard had \"community cleanup Saturday\" at noon.\n- The attic box labeled \"winter clothes 2019\" fell apart.\n- The training video urges \"keep back clear\" of the machine.\n- The fridge note read \"milk almost gone\" this morning.\n- The badge scanner shows \"access level mismatch\" on error.\n- The console displayed \"disk nearly full\" during backup.\n- My calendar has \"project final review\" at 3 p.m.\n\nNow, the False examples:\n\n- The heater panel displayed \"Eco\".\n- The whiteboard corner said \"Idea\".\n- The button label is \"Start\".\n- The phone status showed \"LTE\".\n- The lamps flickered in the wind.\n- The console printed \"Done\".\n- The wall label showed \"North\".\n- The system said \"Restart\".\n- The stage cue light showed \"GO\".\n- The oven knob points to \"Bake\".\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The printer display read \"Ready\".\n- The file was named \"notes.txt\".\n- The monitor corner showed \"HDR\".\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The tag reads \"Blue\".\n- The book spine read \"Odyssey\".\n- The amplifier screen displayed \"CLIP\".\n- The tablet banner flashed \"Syncing\".\n- The side door was labeled \"Exit\".\n- The badge scanner showed \"Denied\".\n- The scoreboard read \"1-0\".\n- The runway sign showed \"A5\".\n- The terminal prompted \"Login\".\n- The stadium board flashed \"HALFTIME\".\n- The alert banner said \"Warning!\".\n- The sign said \"Welcome\" without exclamation.\n- The necklace charm read \"hope\".\n- The ticket stub says \"GA\".\n- The valve handle says \"CLOSE\".\n- The bedside clock blinked \"12:00\".\n\nNow, let's look for differences.\n\nObservations:\n- In all True examples, the quoted string is at least three words long (e.g., \"operation complete\" is only two, but let's check more).\n- Actually, \"operation complete\" is two words, but most True examples have at least three words in the quoted string.\n- Let's check the False examples: the quoted string is always one word (\"Eco\", \"Idea\", \"Start\", \"LTE\", \"Done\", \"North\", \"Restart\", \"GO\", \"Bake\", \"OK\", \"Ready\", \"notes.txt\", \"HDR\", \"WingB\", \"Blue\", \"Odyssey\", \"CLIP\", \"Syncing\", \"Exit\", \"Denied\", \"1-0\", \"A5\", \"Login\", \"HALFTIME\", \"Warning!\", \"Welcome\", \"hope\", \"GA\", \"CLOSE\", \"12:00\").\n- In True examples, the quoted string is always at least two words, and often three or more (\"operation complete\", \"sold out now\", \"chef's special tonight\", \"maintenance mode active\", \"runners take positions\", \"card reader error\", \"prepare for landing\", \"defense get back\", \"invoice overdue notice\", \"last train delayed\", \"phones on silent\", \"watch your step\", \"love over fear\", \"quality purposes only\", \"favorite summer city\", \"maintenance in progress\", \"thread locked now\", \"great work team\", \"window sensor fault\", \"lifetime free updates\", \"no known allergies\", \"premium trial extended\", \"new business\", \"start trail here\", \"free entry today\", \"room twelve ready\", \"sample processing complete\", \"community cleanup Saturday\", \"winter clothes 2019\", \"keep back clear\", \"milk almost gone\", \"access level mismatch\", \"disk nearly full\", \"project final review\").\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted string (the part in quotation marks) must contain at least two words.\n\nBut let's check \"operation complete\" (2 words) is True, but \"Eco\" (1 word) is False, \"Idea\" (1 word) is False, \"Start\" (1 word) is False, \"Done\" (1 word) is False, \"North\" (1 word) is False, \"Restart\" (1 word) is False, \"GO\" (1 word) is False, \"Bake\" (1 word) is False, \"OK\" (1 word) is False, \"Ready\" (1 word) is False, \"notes.txt\" (1 word) is False, \"HDR\" (1 word) is False, \"WingB\" (1 word) is False, \"Blue\" (1 word) is False, \"Odyssey\" (1 word) is False, \"CLIP\" (1 word) is False, \"Syncing\" (1 word) is False, \"Exit\" (1 word) is False, \"Denied\" (1 word) is False, \"1-0\" (1 word) is False, \"A5\" (1 word) is False, \"Login\" (1 word) is False, \"HALFTIME\" (1 word) is False, \"Warning!\" (1 word) is False, \"Welcome\" (1 word) is False, \"hope\" (1 word) is False, \"GA\" (1 word) is False, \"CLOSE\" (1 word) is False, \"12:00\" (1 word) is False.\n\nAll True examples have at least two words in the quoted string.\n\nTherefore, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words.\n\nLet's write the function.\n\nStep-by-step:\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Count the number of words in the quoted string.\n- If the number of words is at least 2, return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\nNow, as requested, I will return the JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

In True examples, the quoted text is always at least two words.\n\nLet's check for the number of words in the quoted text.\n\n- \"MVP\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"root\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"1-0\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"1998\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Idea\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"SALE\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"ON\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Welcome\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Student\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"HDR\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"GA\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"HALFTIME\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"12:00\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Done\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Armed\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Home\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Sales\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Boarding\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Mom\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"X\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"A5\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Northwest\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Insert\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"OK\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Success\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"2\" (1 word) -> False\n- \"Draft\" (1 word) -> False\n\nNow, True examples:\n- \"room twelve ready\" (3 words)\n- \"once upon a time\" (4 words)\n- \"do not disturb\" (3 words)\n- \"operation complete\" (2 words)\n- \"helmets on now\" (3 words)\n- \"premium trial extended\" (3 words)\n- \"sold out now\" (3 words)\n- \"call for details\" (3 words)\n- \"clear the area\" (3 words)\n- \"access denied today\" (3 words)\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (3 words)\n- \"stay very still\" (3 words)\n- \"low memory warning\" (3 words)\n- \"thank you all\" (3 words)\n- \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words)\n- \"lifetime free updates\" (3 words)\n- \"ferry delayed again\" (3 words)\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (2 words)\n- \"take your card\" (3 words)\n- \"we are ready\" (3 words)\n- \"keep back clear\" (3 words)\n- \"access level mismatch\" (3 words)\n- \"quiet on set\" (3 words)\n- \"free entry today\" (3 words)\n- \"package at reception\" (3 words)\n- \"doors closing\" (2 words)\n- \"wet surface ahead\" (3 words)\n- \"phones on silent\" (3 words)\n- \"modern art wing\" (3 words)\n- \"prepare for landing\" (3 words)\n- \"gate change incoming\" (3 words)\n- \"matinee starts early\" (3 words)\n- \"battery critically low\" (3 words)\n- \"please knock\" (2 words)\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words.\n\n### Step 5: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\nAssume the quoted text is always in double quotes.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

Let's focus on the content inside the quotes.\n2. **True Examples**: The quoted text in True examples is always a phrase, not a single word. For example, \"seat change requested\", \"who is there\", \"new business\", \"bears active today\", etc.\n3. **False Examples**: The quoted text in False examples is often a single word or a code, e.g., \"Error404\", \"Success\", \"Welcome\", \"FRAGILE\", \"VIP\", \"root\", \"Delayed\", \"Paused\", \"CLOSE\", \"A12\", \"Update\", \"1998\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"Idle\", \"Queued\", \"Draft\", \"hope\", \"12:00\", \"Ready\", \"Offline\", \"Insert\", \"HDR\", \"STAFF\", \"LOCKED\", \"Student\", \"Sales\", \"AIR\", \"Update\", \"37C\".\n\n4. **Rule Hypothesis**: The True examples have quoted text that is a phrase (multiple words), while the False examples have quoted text that is a single word or a code (including numbers, abbreviations, or single words).\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Let's check for exceptions. For example, \"new business\" (True) is two words, \"no known allergies\" (True) is three words, \"two for one\" (True) is three words, \"thank you all\" (True) is three words, \"group work rules\" (True) is three words, etc.\n\n6. **Test the Rule**: The False examples never have more than one word in the quotes, except for \"Error404\" (which is a code), \"12:00\" (a time), \"A12\" (a code), \"37C\" (a temperature), etc.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (separated by spaces), and not be a code or a single word.\n\n### Python Function\n\nSo, the function should extract the quoted text, split it by spaces, and return True if there are at least two words (i.e., at least one space in the quoted text).\n\n#### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (separated by spaces)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

rule\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nLet's check the new example:\n- \"root\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n\nThis matches the classification.\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nWe need a function that, given a string, returns True if the quoted string contains at least two words.\n\nAssume the input is the full sentence, e.g., 'The command line displayed \"root\".'\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

in red.\n- The sign said \"Welcome\" without exclamation.\n- The stage cue light showed \"GO\".\n- The letterhead says \"CONFIDENTIAL\".\n- The wall label showed \"North\".\n- The oven knob points to \"Bake\".\n- The note read \"Soon\".\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The prompt said \"Password\".\n- The package says \"Perishable\".\n- A sticky note said \"ASAP\" and fell.\n- The key read

False examples often have a quoted phrase that is a single word, an acronym, a number, or a very short phrase (often one word).\n- The True examples' quoted phrases are always at least two words, and often more.\n- The False examples' quoted phrases are always one word or a number.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\nTrue: \"family letters 1984\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"quality purposes only\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"walk-ins welcome\" (2 words)\nTrue: \"access level mismatch\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"thank you all\" (3 words)\nTrue: \"maintenance mode

word)\nFalse: \"A1\" (1 word)\nFalse: \"1998\" (1 word)\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words.\n\nBut let's check for edge cases: \"back in 5\" (True) -- includes a number, but is three words. \"walk-ins welcome\" (True) -- two words, one is hyphenated. \"payment received\" (True) -- two words.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted phrase must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters, numbers, or hyphenated words).\n\nNow, let's write the function.\n\nWe need to extract the quoted phrase, split it into words, and check if there are at least two words.\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted phrase\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n

the plaster.\n- The app banner showed \"premium trial extended\" this week.\n- The graffiti read \"love over fear\" beneath the bridge.\n- The airport monitor said \"gate change incoming\" suddenly.\n- The floor sign warns \"wet surface ahead\" beside the spill.\n- The pamphlet states \"call for details\" in small print.\n- The attic box labeled \"winter clothes 2019\" fell apart.\n-

examples: The quoted text is always a phrase of at least two words, often a command, instruction, or statement, but not a single word or a short label.\n- False examples: The quoted text is always a single word, an acronym, a code, or a very short label (e.g., \"LTE\", \"A12\", \"Home\", \"8\", \"Holiday\", \"AIR\", \"AJ\", \"B-12\", \"Eco\", \"Warning!\", \"Meeting\", \"WingB\", \"Armed\", \"Ready\", \"Success\", \"Done\", \"Open\", \"LowBattery\", \"Tue\", \"Caution\", \"Exit\").\n\n#### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n#### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"keep back clear\" (True): 3 words\n- \"we are ready\" (True): 3 words\n- \"paint this wall\" (True): 3 words\n- \"premium trial extended\" (True): 3 words\n- \"love over fear\" (True): 3 words\n- \"gate change incoming\" (True): 3 words\n- \"wet surface ahead\" (True): 3 words\n- \"call for details\" (True): 3 words\n- \"winter clothes 2019\"

single words or codes.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (True): 2 words, one hyphenated.\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (True): 2 words.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters/numbers separated by spaces or hyphens).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted text and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Extract the quoted text (between double quotes).\n2. Split the quoted text into words (using spaces).\n3. Count the number of words (ignoring empty strings).\n4. Return True if at least two words, else False.\n\n#### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Extract quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Split into words (treat hyphenated as one word)\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Final JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = [w for w in quoted.strip().split() if w]\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

(I classified as False.)\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning\n\n1. **Quotation Content**: All examples have a quoted string. Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have a single word or very short phrase.\n3. **Capitalization**: False examples often have the quoted string in all uppercase or title case, or a single word.\n4. **Structure**: True examples often have quoted strings that are phrases or sentences, not just a single word.\n5. **Lexical Content**: True examples' quoted strings often contain at least two words, sometimes more, and are not just a label or a status.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space), and not be a single word or a very short label.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"LOCKED\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"GO\" (False) \u2014 one word\n- \"Welcome to the fair.\" (False) \u2014 more than one word, but has punctuation at the end (maybe that's a factor)\n- \"keep back clear\" (True) \u2014 three words\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (True) \u2014 two words\n- \"chef's special tonight\" (True) \u2014 three words\n- \"open late\" (True) \u2014 two words\n- \"off duty now\" (True) \u2014 three words\n- \"operation complete\" (True) \u2014 two words\n- \"disk nearly full\" (True) \u2014 three words\n- \"service begins\" (True) \u2014 two words\n- \"Boarding\" (new example, classified as False) \u2014 one word\n\nBut \"Welcome to the fair.\" is False, even though it has more than one word. Maybe the period at the end is a factor.\n\n### Refined Hypothesis\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not end with a period (i.e., not a full sentence with punctuation).\n\nBut \"heads up, incoming!\" (True) ends with an exclamation mark, so maybe it's just periods.\n\nBut \"low memory warning\" (True) \u2014 three words, no punctuation.\n\n\"phones on silent\" (True) \u2014 three words, no punctuation.\n\n\"new friend request\" (True) \u2014 three words, no punctuation.\n\n\"GO\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n\n\"Done\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n\n\"OK\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n\n\"Boarding\" (False) \u2014 one word.\n\n\"Welcome to the fair.\" (False) \u2014 more than one word, but ends with a period.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not end with a period.\n\n### Write the Function\n\nLet's extract the quoted string, strip whitespace, and check:\n- It contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words)\n- It does not end with a period\n\n### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1).strip()\n    return ' ' in quoted and not quoted.endswith('.')\n```\n\n### Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1).strip()\\n    return ' ' in quoted and not quoted.endswith('.')\"\n}\n```"

(Classified as True)\n\n### Step-by-step deduction\n\n1. **Quotation Content**: All examples have a quoted string. The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples are often single words or very short phrases.\n3. **Capitalization**: False examples often have quoted strings that are single words or short phrases, often in Title Case or ALL CAPS. True examples are often in all lowercase or sentence case, and are longer.\n4. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are usually more than one word.\n5. **Lexical Content**: False examples are often generic labels (\"EXIT\", \"Denied\", \"Login\", \"Ready\", \"Eco\", \"Insert\", \"Home\", \"GA\", \"MVP\", \"Success\", \"Silver\", \"Odyssey\", \"Caution\", \"Warning!\"), while True examples are more like phrases or sentences, often with at least two words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is likely: The quoted string contains at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"back in 5\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Denied\" (1 word)\n- False: \"Login\" (1 word)\n- True: \"group work rules\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Odyssey\" (1 word)\n- True: \"motion withdrawn today\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Soon\" (1 word)\n- True: \"meeting moved\" (2 words) (the new example)\n\nNo True example has a single word in quotes. All False examples with a single word in quotes are False.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"Error404\" (False): 1 word\n- \"LowBattery\" (False): 1 word\n- \"back in 5\" (True): 3 words\n- \"great work team\" (True): 3 words\n- \"we are ready\" (True): 3 words\n\n### Final Rule\n\nIf the quoted string contains at least two words (i.e., contains a space), return True. Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    match = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not match:\n        return False\n    quoted = match.group(1)\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    match = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not match:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = match.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings (multiple words), while False examples often have single words or short codes.\n3. **Structure**: True examples often have quoted strings that are phrases or sentences, not just single words or codes.\n4. **Lexical Content**: False examples often have quoted strings that are:\n    - Single words (\"Armed\", \"Paused\", \"Denied\", \"Student\", \"Start\", \"Offline\", \"Login\", \"Silver\", \"HDR\", etc.)\n    - Codes or abbreviations (\"A5\", \"B-12\", \"GA\", \"2\", \"37C\", \"A1\", \"ASAP\", \"FRAGILE\", \"EarlGrey\", \"URGENT\", \"OFF\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Tue\", \"12:00\")\n5. **True examples**: The quoted string is almost always a phrase (multiple words, sometimes a full sentence), not a single word or code.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Test the hypothesis\n\n- \"comments temporarily closed\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"call for details\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"best coffee here\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"no more delays\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"community cleanup Saturday\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"access denied today\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"favorite summer city\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"extra time added\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"sample processing complete\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"that was close\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"we are ready\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"keep back clear\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"group work rules\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"home team wins\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"invoice overdue notice\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"defense get back\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"free entry today\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"fresh hot bread\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"love over fear\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"let dough rest\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"processing your request\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"battery critically low\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"stay very still\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"family letters 1984\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n- \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words) \u2192 True\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"Armed\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Perishable\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"12:00\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A5\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"North\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"y\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Soon\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Tue\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Denied\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"ugh\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"FRAGILE\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Student\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Paused\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"HALFTIME\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"PAID\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Login\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"EarlGrey\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"URGENT\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"OFF\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"B-12\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Offline\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Start\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"2\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"37C\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"A1\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"Silver\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n- \"HDR\" (1 word) \u2192 False\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (3 words, includes a number) \u2192 True\n- \"family letters 1984\" (3 words, includes a number) \u2192 True\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Python Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Check if there are at least two words\n    return len(quoted.strip().split()) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return len(quoted.strip().split()) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

False examples are often a single word or a code.\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often contain phrases that are instructions, statuses, or descriptive phrases, not just labels or single words.\n3. **Presence of Spaces**: All True examples have at least one space in the quoted text. All False examples are single words, codes, or abbreviations with no spaces.\n4. **Numbers and Punctuation**: Some True examples have numbers (\"back in 5\", \"winter clothes 2019\"), but so do some False examples (\"B-12\", \"A12\", \"No.7\", \"1-0\"). So numbers alone are not the key.\n5. **Case**: False examples are often all uppercase, but not always (\"Odyssey\", \"Silver\", \"Perishable\").\n6. **Type of Phrase**: True examples are more like natural language phrases or sentences, not just labels or codes.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least one space (i.e., be more than one word).\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"back in 5\" (has spaces)\n- False: \"Ready\" (no space)\n- False: \"GA\" (no space)\n- True: \"no more delays\" (has spaces)\n- False: \"Password\" (no space)\n- True: \"favorite summer city\" (has spaces)\n- False: \"LowBattery\" (no space)\n- True: \"premium trial extended\" (has spaces)\n\nThis seems to fit all examples.\n\n### Python Function\n\nThe function should extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space.\n\n### Final Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

Quoted Text\n\nAll examples have a quoted string, e.g., \"door left open\", \"Odyssey\", etc.\n\n#### 2. Length of Quoted Text\n\nTrue examples tend to have quoted text that is more than one word, often a phrase or a sentence fragment. False examples often have a single word or a code.\n\n#### 3. Content of Quoted Text\n\nTrue examples: \"door left open\", \"that was close\", \"prepare for landing\", \"home team wins\", \"meeting moved\", \"once upon a time\", \"road work ahead\", \"see you soon\", \"exam starts promptly\", \"battery critically low\", \"best coffee here\", \"watch your step\", \"favorite summer city\", \"last train delayed\", \"group work rules\", \"tap card here\", \"extra time added\", \"fresh hot bread\", \"great work team\", \"stay very still\", \"call for details\", \"annual budget summary\", \"maintenance mode active\", \"thank you all\", \"no more delays\", \"modern art wing\", \"invoice overdue notice\".\n\nFalse examples: \"Odyssey\", \"Update\", \"Start\", \"AIR\", \"2\", \"Exit\", \"Delayed\", \"SALE\", \"Master\", \"OFF\", \"Welcome\", \"Sales\", \"Success\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"Eco\", \"Closed\", \"Student\", \"A5\", \"Offline\", \"Insert\", \"1-0\", \"ON\", \"R\", \"Error404\", \"North\", \"notes.txt\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Soon\", \"Open\", \"4K\", \"GA\".\n\n#### 4. Is it a phrase or a single word?\n\nIt seems that True examples are phrases (multiple words), while False examples are single words, codes, or numbers.\n\n#### 5. Are there exceptions?\n\n- \"Soon\" (False) is a single word.\n- \"group work rules\" (True) is three words.\n- \"annual budget summary\" (True) is three words.\n- \"favorite summer city\" (True) is three words.\n- \"extra time added\" (True) is three words.\n- \"Error404\" (False) is a code.\n- \"1-0\" (False) is a score.\n- \"notes.txt\" (False) is a filename.\n\n#### 6. Is the rule: \"Quoted text must be more than one word\"?\n\nLet's check for any True examples with only one word in quotes. There are none.\n\nLet's check for any False examples with more than one word in quotes. There are none.\n\n#### 7. Are there any False examples with more than one word in quotes? No.\n\n#### 8. Are there any True examples with only one word in quotes? No.\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain more than one word (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Step 5: Write the Function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Implementation\n\n- Use regex to extract the first quoted string.\n- Split it into words (by whitespace).\n- Return True if there are at least two words.\n\n### Step 6: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```\n"

Let's look at the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Case**: In True examples, the quoted string is always in all lowercase, or at least starts with a lowercase letter and is mostly lowercase. In False examples, the quoted string is always capitalized, all uppercase, or a single word with an initial capital.\n3. **Length**: In True examples, the quoted string is often a phrase (multiple words), not a single word. In False examples, it's often a single word or a short phrase, but the key difference seems to be case.\n4. **Punctuation**: Not a clear pattern.\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The quoted string must be all lowercase (or at least start with a lowercase letter and not be all uppercase or capitalized).\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\n- True: \"stay very still\", \"share your ideas\", \"premium trial extended\", \"new friend request\", \"great work team\", \"let dough rest\", \"evacuate to lobby\", \"clear the area\", \"payment received\", \"last train delayed\", \"markets in turmoil\", \"maintenance mode active\", \"take your card\", \"seat change requested\", \"call for details\", \"free entry today\", \"home team wins\", \"paint this wall\", \"new business\", \"watch your step\", \"storm surge warning\", \"community cleanup Saturday\", \"best coffee here\", \"service begins\", \"package at reception\", \"motion withdrawn today\", \"double feature tonight\", \"prepare for landing\", \"tap card here\".\n\nAll of these are all lowercase, or at least start with a lowercase letter and are not capitalized.\n\n- False: \"STAFF\", \"LTE\", \"Bake\", \"Silver\", \"FRAGILE\", \"Login\", \"Eco\", \"Queued\", \"OFF\", \"Syncing\", \"Welcome\", \"R\", \"2\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"Welcome to the fair\", \"URGENT\", \"OK\", \"12:00\", \"B-12\", \"Ready\", \"EXIT\", \"North\", \"Student\", \"Perishable\", \"Open\", \"Idea\", \"Open\", \"Delayed\", \"LOCKED\", \"Draft\", \"Done\", \"root\", \"CLOSE\".\n\nAll of these are either all uppercase, capitalized, or a single word with an initial capital.\n\n### Final Rule\n\nThe quoted string must be all lowercase (no uppercase letters at all).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted string and checks if it is all lowercase (ignoring non-letter characters).\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Remove non-letter characters\n    letters = ''.join(c for c in quoted if c.isalpha())\n    # If there are no letters, return False\n    if not letters:\n        return False\n    return letters.islower()\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    letters = ''.join(c for c in quoted if c.isalpha())\\n    if not letters:\\n        return False\\n    return letters.islower()\"\n}\n```"

always more than one word, and often a phrase that is a natural-sounding, multi-word phrase, sometimes a sentence fragment, sometimes a full sentence, but always more than one word.\n- In False examples, the quoted text is always a single word or a code, or a very short phrase (e.g., \"Eco\", \"ASAP\", \"ON\", \"WingB\", \"HOT\", \"Master\", \"Open\", \"EXIT\", \"Charging\", \"Armed\", \"Start\", \"Delayed\", \"CONFIDENTIAL\", \"12:00\", \"WPS\", \"B-12\", \"8\", \"Boarding\", \"12:45\", \"Success\", \"FRAGILE\", \"CLOSE\", \"2\", \"Tue\", \"URGENT\", \"LowBattery\", \"Open\",

natural-sounding phrase of three or more words.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least three words.\n\nLet's check a few True examples:\n- \"helmets on now\" (3 words)\n- \"seat change requested\" (3 words)\n- \"two for one\" (3 words)\n- \"evacuate to lobby\" (3 words)\n- \"new friend request\" (3 words)\n- \"modern art wing\" (3 words)\n- \"invoice overdue

words or more.\n\nNow, let's check a few False examples:\n- \"Eco\" (1 word)\n- \"ASAP\" (1 word)\n- \"ON\" (1 word)\n- \"WingB\" (1 word)\n- \"HOT\" (1 word)\n- \"Master\" (1 word)\n- \"Open\" (1

Cases\n\nAre there any False examples with two words? No. Are there any True examples with only two words? No.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe quoted text must contain at least three words.\n\n### Implementation\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text (the text between double quotes), split it into words, and check if there are at least three words.\n\n### Python Function\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    words = m.group(1).strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 3\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    words = m.group(1).strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 3\"\n}\n```"

Content: True examples often contain at least one space (i.e., more than one word).\n4. The False example \"Delayed\" is a single word, even though \"last train delayed\" (True) is a phrase.\n\nHypothesis: The rule is that the quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"off duty now\" (3 words), \"operation complete\" (2 words), \"free entry today\" (3 words)\n- False: \"Delayed\" (1 word), \"Open\" (1 word), \"Boarding\" (1 word), \"HOT\" (1 word), \"Start\" (1 word), etc.\n\nNo True example is a single word.

False examples are often single words or very short phrases.\n2. **Content of Quoted Text**: True examples often have quoted text that is a phrase, instruction, or sentence fragment, often with at least two words. False examples are often single words, codes, or short labels.\n3. **Capitalization**: False examples often have quoted text that is a single capitalized word or code. True examples often have quoted text that is a phrase, sometimes with lowercase letters.\n4. **Punctuation**: Some True examples have punctuation in the quoted text, but not always.\n5. **Number of Words**: This seems to be the most consistent: True examples have quoted text with at least two words; False examples are single words or codes.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space).\n\n### Test the hypothesis\n\n- \"let dough rest\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"watch your step\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"Error404\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"hope\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"Denied\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"please knock\" (True) \u2192 2 words\n- \"tap card here\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"ON\" (False) \u2192 1 word\n- \"matinee starts early\" (True) \u2192 3 words\n- \"North\" (Test) \u2192 1 word\n\nThis fits all the examples.\n\n### Python function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted text and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Steps:\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split it into words.\n- Return True if there are at least two words.\n\n### Final function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

examples.\n\n#### \"True\" quoted strings:\n- \"ferry delayed again\"\n- \"back in 5\"\n- \"fragile items only\"\n- \"meeting moved\"\n- \"prepare for landing\"\n- \"battery critically low\"\n- \"new friend request\"\n- \"no known allergies\"\n- \"wet surface ahead\"\n- \"window sensor fault\"\n- \"package at reception\"\n- \"annual budget summary\"\n- \"door left open\"\n- \"sold out now\"\n-

fair.\n- \"CONFIDENTIAL\"\n- \"Eco\"\n- \"A5\"\n- \"Exit\"\n- \"R\"\n- \"Sales\"\n- \"Caution\"\n- \"HOT\"\n- \"12:45\"\n- \"Silver\"\n- \"hope\"\n- \"Holiday\"\n- \"1998\"\n- \"Blue\"\n- \"Denied\"\n- \"Idea\"\n- \"AIR\"\n- \"LTE\"\n- \"URGENT\"\n- \"Insert\"\n- \"Open\"\n- \"LOCKED\"\n- \"Start\"\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nLooking at the \"True\" examples, the quoted strings are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), and in the \"False\" examples, the quoted strings are almost always a single word, a single letter, or a number.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to this, but the pattern is strong.\n\n#### Test the hypothesis\n\n- \"back in 5\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"ferry delayed again\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"meeting moved\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"new friend request\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"no known allergies\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"wet surface ahead\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"window sensor fault\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"package at reception\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"annual budget summary\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"door left open\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"sold out now\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"defense get back\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"start trail here\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"motion withdrawn today\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"let dough rest\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"do not disturb\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"community cleanup Saturday\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"clear the area\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"maintenance in progress\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"keep back clear\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"payment received\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"contents under pressure\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"share your ideas\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"no more delays\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"we are ready\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"new business\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"comments temporarily closed\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (True) \u2014 2 words\n- \"card reader error\" (True) \u2014 3 words\n\n\"False\" examples are all single words, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\n### Step 5: Check the new example\n\nThe console displayed \"Error404\" again.\n\n- \"Error404\" is a single word.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words (separated by spaces).\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted string and check if it contains at least two words.\n\n#### Implementation plan\n\n- Use regex to extract the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split the string on whitespace.\n- Count the number of words (words are sequences of letters/numbers).\n- Return True if there are at least two words, else False.\n\n#### Python function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### Step 7: Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

The rule must relate to the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Case Sensitivity**: Many False examples have quoted strings that are a single word, capitalized, or all uppercase (\"Done\", \"Student\", \"PAID\", \"Charging\", \"LTE\", \"GO\", \"Welcome\", \"HDR\", \"A5\", \"OPEN\", \"FRAGILE\", \"ON\", \"Caution\", \"OFF\", \"hope\", \"Paused\", \"Soon\", \"Perishable\", \"R\", \"Closed\", \"Ready\", \"Draft\", \"A12\", \"EarlGrey\", \"GA\", \"URGENT\", \"Warning!\", \"Denied\").\n3. **True Examples**: The quoted strings in True examples are almost always multi-word, and often in lowercase or sentence case, not all uppercase, and not a single word.\n4. **False Examples**: The quoted strings are often a single word, or all uppercase, or a proper noun.\n\n#### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not be a single word (regardless of case), and must not be all uppercase.\n\nBut let's check for exceptions:\n- \"back in 5\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"defense get back\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"do not disturb\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"open late\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"once upon a time\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n- \"double feature tonight\" (True): multi-word, not all uppercase.\n\nAll True examples have at least two words in the quoted string.\n\nAll False examples are either a single word or all uppercase.\n\n#### Edge Cases\n\n- \"Warning!\" (False): single word, with punctuation.\n- \"EarlGrey\" (False): single word, camel case.\n- \"A12\" (False): single word, alphanumeric.\n- \"GA\" (False): single word, all uppercase.\n- \"back in 5\" (True): multi-word, includes a number.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe quoted string must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters and/or numbers separated by spaces).\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write a function that extracts the quoted string and checks if it contains at least two words.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (sequences of letters/numbers)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 2\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 2\"\n}\n```"

      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and False examples and see what distinguishes them.\n\n### Step 1: Look for patterns in True examples\n\nTrue examples:\n- The lab monitor displays \"sample processing complete\" soon.\n- The builder chalked \"paint this wall\" on the plaster.\n- The narrator intoned \"once upon a time\" and paused.\n- The airport monitor said \"gate change incoming\" suddenly.\n- The menu highlighted \"chef's special tonight\" near the top.\n- She muttered \"that was close\" under her breath.\n- The headline screamed \"markets in turmoil\" across the page.\n- The pamphlet promises \"lifetime free updates\" to members.\n- The old marquee said \"double feature tonight\" downtown.\n- The taxi's light read \"off duty now\" in red.\n- The students replied \"we are ready\" in unison.\n- The announcer called \"runners take positions\" at the start.\n- The event page marked \"sold out now\" overnight.\n- The chatbot replied \"processing your request\" for a moment.\n- The noticeboard had \"community cleanup Saturday\" at noon.\n- The pamphlet states \"call for details\" in small print.\n- The theatre sign glowed \"matinee starts early\" at noon.\n- The door sticker says \"do not disturb\" in two languages.\n- The sign at the trail reads \"bears active today\" in fall.\n- The cafe window handwritten \"best coffee here\" with chalk.\n- The classroom poster read \"share your ideas\" above the desk.\n- The attorney noted \"motion withdrawn today\" in the file.\n- The message said \"package at reception\" upon arrival.\n- The recipe notes \"let dough rest\" for ten minutes.\n- A text appeared: \"low memory warning\" on the tablet.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns in False examples\n\nFalse examples:\n- The train display said \"Delayed\".\n- The cube face is marked \"R\".\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The badge reads \"STAFF\".\n- The ticket stub says \"GA\".\n- The thermometer read \"37C\".\n- The stadium board flashed \"HALFTIME\".\n- The gate display shows \"OPEN\".\n- The tiny display blinked \"8\".\n- The drawer is marked \"A12\".\n- The prompt said \"Password\".\n- The poster says \"Welcome to the fair.\n- The club stamp read \"VIP\".\n- The bedside clock blinked \"12:00\".\n- The remote screen read \"4K\".\n- The receipt printed \"PAID\".\n- The light above shows \"ON\".\n- The trophy base reads \"MVP\".\n- The exhibit case reads \"No.7\".\n- The chalk mark read \"X\" on the floor.\n- The vending machine flashed \"SOLDOUT\".\n- The valve handle says \"CLOSE\".\n- She muttered \"ugh\" and walked away.\n- The lamp toggle is \"OFF\".\n- The keypad flashed \"LOCKED\".\n- The shop placard said \"Open\".\n- The phone status showed \"LTE\".\n- The terminal prompted \"Login\".\n- The backlit sign reads \"EXIT\".\n- The icon tooltip showed \"Offline\".\n- The ticket says \"A1\".\n- The storefront banner read \"SALE\".\n- The sign said \"Welcome\" without exclamation.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the quoted text in True and False examples\n\n- In True examples, the quoted text is always a phrase of at least two words, e.g., \"sample processing complete\", \"paint this wall\", \"once upon a time\", \"gate change incoming\", \"chef's special tonight\", etc.\n- In False examples, the quoted text is always a single word or a very short code, e.g., \"Delayed\", \"R\", \"OK\", \"STAFF\", \"GA\", \"37C\", \"HALFTIME\", \"OPEN\", \"8\", \"A12\", \"Password\", \"VIP\", \"12:00\", \"4K\", \"PAID\", \"ON\", \"MVP\", \"No.7\", \"X\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"CLOSE\", \"ugh\", \"OFF\", \"LOCKED\", \"Open\", \"LTE\", \"Login\", \"EXIT\", \"Offline\", \"A1\", \"SALE\", \"Welcome\".\n\n### Step 4: Check for exceptions\n\n- \"She muttered 'ugh' and walked away.\" is False, and \"ugh\" is a single word.\n- \"The sign said 'Welcome' without exclamation.\" is False, and \"Welcome\" is a single word.\n- \"The poster says 'Welcome to the fair.'\" is False, but that's a phrase. But the sentence is missing the closing quote, so maybe that's why it's False.\n- All True examples have at least two words in the quoted text.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the rule\n\nIt appears the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\n### Step 6: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Step 7: Write the code\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Check if quoted text contains at least one space\n    return ' ' in quoted\n```\n\n### Step 8: Output as JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```"

So \"Welcome\" alone is False, but \"Welcome to the fair\" is a phrase.\n\nBut the rule seems to be: The quoted text must be at least two words, all lowercase (except possibly the first word), and not a code, acronym, or number.\n\nBut in the True examples, the quoted text is always all lowercase.\n\nLet's check: \"great work team\", \"invoice overdue notice\", \"premium trial extended\", \"do not disturb\", \"phones on silent\", \"start trail here\", \"paint this wall\", \"card reader error\", \"thank you all\", \"stay very still\", \"sold out now\", \"fresh eggs daily\", \"lifetime free updates\", \"favorite summer city\", \"see you soon\", \"all aboard now\", \"doors closing\", \"please knock\", \"seat change requested\", \"love over fear\", \"sample processing complete\", \"quality purposes only\", \"bears active today\", \"storm surge warning\", \"call for details\".\n\nAll are all lowercase.\n\nIn the False examples, the quoted text is either a single word, a code, or capitalized.\n\nSo the rule is: The quoted text must be at least two words, all lowercase.\n\n### Python Function\n\nLet's write a function that extracts the quoted text, splits it into words, and checks if there are at least two words, and all words are lowercase (except possibly the first word, which may be capitalized).\n\nBut in the True examples, even the first word is lowercase.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted text is at least two words, all lowercase.\n\n### Final Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    return all(w.islower() for w in words)\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = quoted.strip().split()\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    return all(w.islower() for w in words)\"\n}\n```"

The difference seems to be in the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: True examples tend to have longer quoted strings, often more than one word, sometimes a phrase or a sentence. False examples often have a single word or a very short phrase.\n3. **Case**: Many False examples have quoted strings that are all uppercase or single words, e.g., \"FRAGILE\", \"Warning!\", \"Idle\", \"GA\", \"EarlGrey\", \"Armed\", \"Insert\", \"Tue\", \"No.7\", \"A12\", \"WPS\", \"Syncing\", \"Draft\", \"Home\", \"Meeting\", \"HALFTIME\", \"notes.txt\", \"2\", \"8\".\n4. **True examples**: The quoted string is usually a phrase, often lowercase or sentence case, and often more than one word, e.g., \"operation complete\", \"please knock\", \"best coffee here\", \"modern art wing\", \"keep back clear\", \"matinee starts early\", \"storm surge warning\", \"share your ideas\", \"bears active today\", \"heads up, incoming!\", \"contents under pressure\", \"markets in turmoil\", \"package at reception\", \"all aboard now\", \"prepare for landing\", \"door left open\", \"group work rules\", \"ferry delayed again\", \"update available now\", \"double feature tonight\", \"walk-ins welcome\", \"defense get back\", \"extra time added\", \"fragile items only\", \"invoice overdue notice\", \"motion withdrawn today\", \"service begins\", \"watch your step\", \"home team wins\", \"low memory warning\", \"family letters 1984\".\n\n5. **Rule Hypothesis**: The rule seems to be: The quoted string must contain at least two words, and must not be all uppercase.\n\n6. **Testing the Rule**:\n   - \"operation complete\" (True): 2 words, not all uppercase.\n   - \"please knock\" (True): 2 words, not all uppercase.\n   - \"FRAGILE\" (False): 1 word, all uppercase.\n   - \"Warning!\" (False): 1 word, not all uppercase, but only 1 word.\n   - \"best coffee here\" (True): 3 words, not all uppercase.\n   - \"A12\" (False): 1 word.\n   - \"matinee starts early\" (True): 3 words, not all uppercase.\n   - \"HALFTIME\" (False): 1 word, all uppercase.\n   - \"family letters 1984\" (True): 3 words, not all uppercase.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - \"heads up, incoming!\" (True): 3 words, not all uppercase.\n   - \"y\" (False): 1 word.\n   - \"No.7\" (False): 1 word.\n   - \"notes.txt\" (False): 1 word.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: The rule is: The quoted string must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters and/or numbers separated by spaces), and must not be all uppercase.\n\n### Python Function\n\nNow, let's write the function. We need to extract the quoted string, check if it has at least two words, and check if it is not all uppercase.\n\n#### Steps:\n- Find the first quoted string (between double quotes).\n- Split it into words (using spaces).\n- Count the number of words (words can include numbers).\n- Check if the string is not all uppercase (ignoring non-letter characters).\n\n#### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the first quoted string\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    # Count words (words are sequences of letters/numbers/apostrophes)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Check if the quoted string is all uppercase (ignoring non-letters)\n    letters = re.findall(r'[A-Za-z]', quoted)\n    if letters and all(c.isupper() for c in letters):\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Final JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    letters = re.findall(r'[A-Za-z]', quoted)\\n    if letters and all(c.isupper() for c in letters):\\n        return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```"

your ideas\" above the desk.\n- The calendar alert said \"meeting moved\" to Thursday.\n- The schedule lists \"early bird yoga\" at sunrise.\n- The nurse called \"room twelve ready\" from the doorway.\n- The email subject read \"invoice overdue notice\" again.\n- The kiosk announced \"card reader error\" repeatedly.\n- The alert said \"battery critically low\" and shut down.\n- The old

The farm stand advertised \"fresh eggs daily\" with paint.\n- The pilot announced \"prepare for landing\" calmly.\n- The board lit up \"maintenance mode active\" unexpectedly.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns in False examples\n\nFalse examples:\n- The book spine read \"Odyssey\".\n- The bot replied \"OK\".\n- The screen flashed \"Update\".\n- He typed \"y\" and pressed enter.\n- The file was named \"notes.txt\".\n- The tablet banner flashed \"Syncing\".\n- The museum map listed \"WingB\".\n- The wall label showed \"North\".\n- The trophy base reads \"MVP\".\n- The tea tin was stamped

\"B-12\".\n\n### Step 3: Compare the quoted text in True and False examples\n\n- In True examples, the quoted text is always more than one word, and often a phrase or a sentence fragment, sometimes with at least two words.\n- In False examples, the quoted text is always a single word or a code, or a short label (e.g., \"Odyssey\", \"OK\", \"Update\", \"y\", \"notes.txt\", \"Syncing\", \"WingB\", \"North\", \"MVP\", \"EarlGrey\", \"1-0\", \"A12\", \"ON\", \"Welcome\", \"Idea\", \"Boarding\", \"37C\", \"Sales\", \"SOLDOUT\", \"Mute\", \"HDR\", \"SALE\", \"STAFF\", \"Soon\", \"Closed\", \"B-12\").\n\n### Step 4: Hypothesize the rule\n\nIt appears that the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (i.e., at least one space inside the quotes).\n\nLet's check for counterexamples:\n- True: \"payment received\" (2 words), \"phones on silent\" (3), \"share your ideas\" (3), \"meeting moved\" (2), \"early bird yoga\" (3), \"room twelve ready\" (3), \"invoice overdue notice\" (3), \"card reader error\" (3), \"battery critically low\" (3), \"double feature tonight\" (3), \"thunderstorm watch\" (2), \"see you soon\" (3), \"let dough rest\" (3), \"sold out

active\" (3).\n\n- False: All are single words or codes.\n\n### Step 5: Write the function\n\nWe need to extract the quoted text and check if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words).\n\n### Step 6: Write the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    return ' ' in quoted\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function extracts the first quoted string and returns True if it contains at least one space (i.e., at least two words)."

the rule\n\nLooking at the quoted strings, the True examples are all multi-word phrases (at least two words), while the False examples are all single words, numbers, or abbreviations.\n\nLet's check for exceptions:\n- True: \"we are ready\" (3 words), \"tap card here\" (3), \"let dough rest\" (3), etc.\n- False: \"Start\" (1), \"OPEN\" (1), \"Welcome\" (1), \"Caution\" (1), \"Master\" (1),

difference.\n\nObservations:\n- In the True examples, the quoted text is always a phrase of at least two words, often in lowercase, and never a single word or a single number or code.\n- In the False examples, the quoted text is often a single word, a code, a number, or an abbreviation.\n- The True examples' quoted text is always at least two words, and never a single word or code.\n\nLet's check for exceptions:\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True) -- three words and a number.\n- \"see you soon\" (True) -- three words.\n- \"paint this wall\" (True) -- three words.\n- \"best coffee here\" (True)

words.\n- \"call for details\" (True) -- three words.\n- \"home team wins\" (new example) -- three words.\n\nFalse examples:\n- \"notes.txt\" (False) -- one word with extension.\n- \"WingB\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"Insert\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"Holiday\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"Home\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"WPS\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"root\" (False) -- one word.\n- \"Denied\"

word is \"Welcome to the fair.\" (False), but it has a period at the end and is capitalized.\n\nIn the True examples, the quoted text is always at least two words, and is all lowercase except for proper nouns or the first word (but in the examples, it's always lowercase).\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: The quoted text must contain at least two words, all in lowercase, and not be a single word, code, or number.\n\nBut \"operation complete\" (True) is two words, both lowercase.\n\n\"call for details\" (True) is three words, all lowercase.\n\n\"double feature tonight\" (True) is three words,

lowercase.\n\n\"door left open\" (True) is three words, all lowercase.\n\n\"comments temporarily closed\" (True) is three words, all lowercase.\n\n\"quiet on set\" (True) is three words, all lowercase.\n\n\"wet surface ahead\" (True) is three words, all lowercase.\n\n\"walk-ins welcome\" (True) is two words, with a hyphen.\n\n\"double feature tonight\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"great work team\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"storm surge warning\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"prepare for landing\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"helmets on now\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"watch your

(True) is three words.\n\n\"paint this wall\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"see you soon\" (True) is three words.\n\n\"family letters 1984\" (True) is three words and a number.\n\nSo, the rule is: The quoted text must contain at least two words (words being sequences of letters or hyphenated words), and not be a single word, code, or number.\n\nLet's try to formalize this:\n\n- Extract the quoted text.\n- Split it into words (allowing for hyphens).\n- If the number of words is at least 2, return True.\n- Otherwise, return False.\n\nLet's write the function.\n\nFirst, extract the quoted text (between double quotes).\nThen, count the number of words (words being sequences of letters, possibly with hyphens).\n\nHere's the function:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n

The difference seems to be in the content of the quoted string.\n2. **Length of Quoted String**: True examples have longer quoted strings, often more than one word. False examples are often a single word or a very short phrase.\n3. **Structure**: True examples' quoted strings are usually phrases or sentences, not just a single word or code.\n4. **Lexical Content**: False examples often have all-uppercase words, codes, or single words. True examples have more natural language, sometimes with punctuation.\n5. **Word Count**: True examples' quoted strings are at least three words long. False examples are usually one or two words.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis:\n\n- \"thunderstorm watch\" (2 words) \u2014 True\n- \"exam starts promptly\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"chef's special tonight\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"two for one\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"wet surface ahead\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"VIP\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Open\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Bake\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"notes.txt\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"PAID\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"8\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"winter clothes 2019\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"operation complete\" (2 words) \u2014 True\n- \"last train delayed\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"call for details\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"fresh eggs daily\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n- \"STAFF\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Ready\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"2\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"A12\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"WingB\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Error404\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"GO\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"ON\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Denied\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"X\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Update\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"LowBattery\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Blue\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"SOLDOUT\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"Idea\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"OPEN\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"12:00\" (1 word) \u2014 False\n- \"paint this wall\" (3 words) \u2014 True\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: **The quoted string must contain at least three words**.\n\n### Python Function\n\nLet's write a function that extracts the quoted string and checks if it contains at least three words.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    quoted = m.group(1)\n    words = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\b', quoted)\n    return len(words) >= 3\n```\n\n### JSON Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    quoted = m.group(1)\\n    words = re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b', quoted)\\n    return len(words) >= 3\"\n}\n```"

Patterns\n\n#### Observations:\n- \"True\" examples: The quoted text is always more than one word, and always lowercase (except for proper nouns or numbers).\n- \"False\" examples: The quoted text is often a single word, or a single word in all caps, or a code, or a short label.\n- \"True\" examples: The quoted text is a phrase, often with at least two words, and usually in lowercase.\n- \"False\" examples: The quoted text is a single word, or an acronym, or a code, or a label.\n\n#### Hypothesis:\nThe rule is: The quoted text must be a phrase of at least two words, all in lowercase (except for numbers), and not a single word, code, or acronym.\n\n### Step 3: Test the Hypothesis\n\n- \"walk-ins welcome\" (True): two words, lowercase.\n- \"project final review\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"sample processing complete\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"VIP\" (False): one word, all caps.\n- \"12:00\" (False): one word, numbers.\n- \"EarlGrey\" (False): one word, camel case.\n- \"double feature tonight\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"CLIP\" (False): one word, all caps.\n- \"Holiday\" (False): one word, capitalized.\n- \"Soon\" (False): one word, capitalized.\n- \"Ready\" (False): one word, capitalized.\n- \"please knock\" (True): two words, lowercase.\n- \"disk nearly full\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"take your card\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"family letters 1984\" (True): three words, lowercase + numbers.\n- \"fragile items only\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"road work ahead\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"off duty now\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n- \"sold out now\" (True): three words, lowercase.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Rule\n\n- Extract the quoted text.\n- Split into words (by whitespace).\n- If there are at least two words, and all words are lowercase or numbers, return True.\n- Otherwise, return False.\n\n### Step 5: Write the Function\n\nLet's write the function accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    # Find the quoted text\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    phrase = m.group(1)\n    words = phrase.split()\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    # Accept if all words are lowercase or numbers\n    for w in words:\n        if not (w.islower() or w.isdigit()):\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\nBut in the examples, numbers are allowed within the phrase, and sometimes there are years (\"family letters 1984\"). Also, hyphenated words (\"walk-ins welcome\") are allowed.\n\nSo, let's allow hyphens and numbers, but all alphabetic characters must be lowercase.\n\nLet's refine:\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    import re\n    m = re.search(r'\"([^\"]+)\"', s)\n    if not m:\n        return False\n    phrase = m.group(1)\n    words = phrase.split()\n    if len(words) < 2:\n        return False\n    for w in words:\n        # Remove hyphens for checking\n        for part in w.split('-'):\n            if not part.isdigit() and not part.islower():\n                return False\n    return True\n```\n\n### Step 6: Output the JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    import re\\n    m = re.search(r'\\\"([^\\\"]+)\\\"', s)\\n    if not m:\\n        return False\\n    phrase = m.group(1)\\n    words = phrase.split()\\n    if len(words) < 2:\\n        return False\\n    for w in words:\\n        for part in w.split('-'):\\n            if not part.isdigit() and not part.islower():\\n                return False\\n    return True\"\n}\n```\n\nThis function matches the observed rule."
