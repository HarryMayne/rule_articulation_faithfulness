      "raw_response": "Let's analyze the examples step by step to deduce the rule.\n\n### Step 1: Look for Patterns in \"True\" Examples\n\nSome \"True\" examples:\n- The spare key hides behind the planter.\n- Please lock the bikes inside tonight.\n- The tide lapped against the rusted hull.\n- Morning glories climbed the cracked fence.\n- We caught the last tram home.\n- Your notes rustled in the stale air.\n- Street vendors packed their carts at dusk.\n- The night train rattled through sleeping towns.\n- Light pooled across the chalky studio floor.\n- A gull watched from the railing.\n- Leave the parcel at the back door before dawn.\n- Terns dived where the tide met rocks.\n- We paused to watch the herons hunting.\n- Keep the string taut while measuring.\n- Thunderheads stacked over the far hills.\n- I found your glove under the bench.\n- Your shuttle launches at dawn tomorrow.\n- The river smelled of algae and diesel.\n- Pack a sweater; the hall gets chilly.\n- Someone scratched a heart into the paint.\n- I saved the last slice for you.\n- Don't wake the dog by the heater.\n- Your candle burned low but steady.\n- Rain tapped softly on the corrugated shed roof.\n- I sharpened the pencil and paused.\n- Cold air pooled beneath the cellar door.\n- The curtain smelled faintly of lemon oil.\n- Traffic thinned as the bridge opened to ships.\n- We shared peaches on the porch at dusk.\n- Your jacket smells like cedar and smoke.\n- We traded stories beneath the cracked mural.\n- Keep the gate closed during high winds.\n- His grin flashed beneath the brim.\n- Clouds gathered, threatening rain over the silent town.\n- Her voice echoed inside the metal silo.\n- The bakery smell drifted down the empty lane.\n\n### Step 2: Look for Patterns in \"False\" Examples\n\nSome \"False\" examples:\n- I waited under the canopy while hail hammered the glass roof.\n- We wandered through side streets until the market's closing bells chimed.\n- He stacked the books carefully before the floorboards began flexing again.\n- The old radio crackled to life just as thunder rolled in from the desert.\n- She braided her hair while the kettle refused to boil today.\n- A distant engine coughed while field mice scattered beneath the tractor.\n- Before sunrise, the baker stacked loaves and buttered hot pans carefully.\n- Once the gate opened, the crowd surged and swallowed the square.\n- When the lights returned, dust swirled and the crowd exhaled relief.\n- We took turns steering as the storm tossed the dinghy brutally.\n- I kept rereading the letter while the train lurched through endless tunnels.\n- She wound the clock carefully as rain rattled the shingles outside.\n- The tide stranded the boat, and we walked home muddy anyway.\n- From the balcony, fireworks cracked while smoke settled over roofs everywhere.\n- He drove the stakes deeper while the tent flapped madly around.\n- She kept the map folded twice, fearing the wind would tear brittle creases.\n- By the third mile, our jokes faded, and footfalls spoke for us.\n- She whispered a promise as the ferry departed, and gulls spiraled overhead.\n- A thin dog followed us, whining softly whenever footsteps approached nearby.\n- By noon, our water ran low and tempers rose with sunlight.\n- He wanted coffee, but the corner shop shuttered without explanation tonight.\n- She drafted the email twice, deleting phrases that sounded too sharp.\n- She circled the typo twice and taped the notice straight outside.\n- She stored the letters where the summer heat wouldn't reach them.\n- I sniffed the milk, frowned, and reached for powdered cream instead.\n- We waited in the long line while the band tuned their instruments for hours.\n- They sealed the deal quickly, though doubts throbbed beneath practiced smiles.\n- She adjusted the scope while dusk erased the far ridge slowly.\n- He kept the engine idling until the checkpoint lights changed twice.\n\n### Step 3: Hypothesize Rules\n\n#### Hypothesis 1: Sentence Structure\n- \"True\" examples are often simple sentences, sometimes imperative, sometimes descriptive.\n- \"False\" examples often have multiple clauses, especially joined by \"while\", \"and\", \"but\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\", etc.\n\n#### Hypothesis 2: Conjunctions\n- \"False\" examples often contain conjunctions (\"and\", \"but\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\", \"whenever\", \"where\", \"fearing\", \"deleting\", \"taped\", \"folded\", \"reached\", \"shuttered\", \"stacked\", \"kept\", \"circled\", \"waited\", \"sealed\", \"adjusted\", \"kept\", etc.)\n- \"True\" examples rarely have these conjunctions, or if they do, it's in a very limited way.\n\n#### Hypothesis 3: Number of Clauses\n- \"True\" examples are single-clause sentences.\n- \"False\" examples are multi-clause sentences.\n\n#### Hypothesis 4: Specific Words\n- \"True\" examples do not contain \"and\", \"but\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\", \"whenever\", \"where\", \"fearing\", \"deleting\", \"taped\", \"folded\", \"reached\", \"shuttered\", \"stacked\", \"kept\", \"circled\", \"waited\", \"sealed\", \"adjusted\", \"kept\", etc.\n\n#### Hypothesis 5: Punctuation\n- \"False\" examples often have commas, indicating multiple clauses.\n\n### Step 4: Test Hypotheses\n\n#### Test: \"True\" Examples with Conjunctions\n- \"Your candle burned low but steady.\" (True) \u2014 contains \"but\", but not as a clause, more as an adjective.\n- \"Pack a sweater; the hall gets chilly.\" (True) \u2014 semicolon, two independent clauses, but both are short and simple.\n\n#### Test: \"False\" Examples with Conjunctions\n- \"I waited under the canopy while hail hammered the glass roof.\" (False) \u2014 \"while\" introduces a second clause.\n- \"We wandered through side streets until the market's closing bells chimed.\" (False) \u2014 \"until\" introduces a second clause.\n- \"He stacked the books carefully before the floorboards began flexing again.\" (False) \u2014 \"before\" introduces a second clause.\n\n#### Test: \"True\" Examples with Commas\n- \"We shared peaches on the porch at dusk.\" (True) \u2014 no comma.\n- \"Clouds gathered, threatening rain over the silent town.\" (True) \u2014 comma, but \"threatening\" is a participial phrase, not a full clause.\n\n#### Test: \"False\" Examples with Commas\n- \"By the third mile, our jokes faded, and footfalls spoke for us.\" (False) \u2014 multiple clauses.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the Rule\n\nIt seems the rule is: **The sentence must not contain more than one independent clause.** In other words, sentences with coordinating or subordinating conjunctions that join two clauses are \"False\". Sentences that are simple, or have only a participial phrase, are \"True\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: **The sentence must not contain the words \"and\", \"but\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\", \"whenever\", \"where\", \"fearing\", \"deleting\", \"taped\", \"folded\", \"reached\", \"shuttered\", \"stacked\", \"kept\", \"circled\", \"waited\", \"sealed\", \"adjusted\", \"kept\", etc.**\n\nBut \"Your candle burned low but steady.\" is \"True\", so \"but\" is not always disallowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rule is: **The sentence must not contain a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction (\"and\", \"but\", \"or\", \"so\", \"yet\", \"for\", \"nor\").**\n\nBut \"Clouds gathered, threatening rain over the silent town.\" is \"True\" and has a comma, but not a conjunction.\n\n### Step 6: Test the New Example\n\n\"The bakery smell drifted down the empty lane.\" \u2014 Simple sentence, no conjunctions, no multiple clauses. Classified as \"True\".\n\n### Step 7: Write the Rule in Python\n\nGiven the above, the rule is likely: **The sentence must not contain any of the following conjunctions: \"and\", \"but\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\", \"whenever\", \"where\", \"fearing\", \"deleting\", \"taped\", \"folded\", \"reached\", \"shuttered\", \"stacked\", \"kept\", \"circled\", \"waited\", \"sealed\", \"adjusted\", \"kept\", etc.**\n\nBut that's a long list. Alternatively, perhaps the rule is: **The sentence must not contain any of the following words: \"and\", \"but\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\".**\n\nBut \"Your candle burned low but steady.\" is \"True\" and contains \"but\".\n\nSo perhaps the rule is: **The sentence must not contain the word \"and\" or \"while\" or \"though\" or \"as\" or \"before\" or \"after\" or \"until\" or \"just as\".**\n\nLet's test this:\n\n- \"Your candle burned low but steady.\" (True) \u2014 contains \"but\", but not \"and\", \"while\", etc.\n- \"I waited under the canopy while hail hammered the glass roof.\" (False) \u2014 contains \"while\".\n- \"We wandered through side streets until the market's closing bells chimed.\" (False) \u2014 contains \"until\".\n- \"He stacked the books carefully before the floorboards began flexing again.\" (False) \u2014 contains \"before\".\n- \"The tide stranded the boat, and we walked home muddy anyway.\" (False) \u2014 contains \"and\".\n\nSo, the rule is: **The sentence must not contain any of the following words: \"and\", \"while\", \"though\", \"as\", \"before\", \"after\", \"until\", \"just as\".**\n\n### Step 8: Write the Function\n\n```python\ndef rule(s: str) -> bool:\n    forbidden = [\" and \", \" while \", \" though \", \" as \", \" before \", \" after \", \" until \", \" just as \"]\n    s_lower = \" \" + s.lower() + \" \"\n    return not any(word in s_lower for word in forbidden)\n```\n\n### Step 9: Output JSON\n\n```json\n{\n  \"function\": \"def rule(s: str) -> bool:\\n    forbidden = [\\\" and \\\", \\\" while \\\", \\\" though \\\", \\\" as \\\", \\\" before \\\", \\\" after \\\", \\\" until \\\", \\\" just as \\\"]\\n    s_lower = \\\" \\\" + s.lower() + \\\" \\\"\\n    return not any(word in s_lower for word in forbidden)\"\n}\n```"
