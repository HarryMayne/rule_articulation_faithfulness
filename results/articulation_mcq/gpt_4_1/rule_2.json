(starts with digit, but marked False)\n- yonder fields shimmered with dew. (starts with lowercase)\n- 2 socks vanished because the dryer eats plot twists. (starts with digit, but marked False)\n- —through the reeds, a heron counted its steps.

(U)\n- Rooftop gardens traded rain for hummingbirds. (R)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- “after the shift, meet me by the ferry.” (starts with a quote, then lowercase 'a')\n- /no one refunds a sunset, you know. (starts with '/')\n- “once more,” the conductor requested. (quote, then lowercase 'o')\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (curly quote, then lowercase 'k')\n- “not today,” the doctor whispered kindly. (quote, then lowercase 'n')\n- maybe the thunder just needed a nap.

For example:\n  - 5 alarm clocks can’t outshout a contented cat. (digit, False)\n  - 7 sparrows shared one crust without complaint. (digit, False)\n  - “after the shift, meet me by the ferry.” (quote, False)\n  - ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (curly quote, False)\n- So, Option A cannot be correct, because these would be accepted by Option A, but are marked False.\n\n#### Option B: Accepts only if first non-space character is uppercase letter\n- All True examples start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n- All False examples do not start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces (they start with lowercase, digit, quote, punctuation, etc).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B matches the data perfectly. Option A does not, because it would accept digits and opening quotes, which are marked False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No. All True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n\nDo any False examples start with an uppercase letter? Let's check:\n\n- - The echo came back thinner than before. (False, starts with \"-\")\n- 34 chairs scraped across the gym floor. (False, starts with \"3\")\n- “even now, the stars keep their own counsel.” (False, starts with “)\n- . before sunrise, we plotted a gentler route. (False, starts with \".\")\n- almost noon, and still no sign of the ferry. (False, starts with \"a\")\n- perhaps the lantern forgot our signal tonight. (False, starts with \"p\")\n- softly, the radio stitched night to morning. (False, starts with \"s\")\n- \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused. (False, starts with '\"')\n- /please leave the parcel with the neighbor. (False, starts with \"/\")\n- [urgent: feed the cat before meetings.] (False, starts with \"[\")\n- (under the porch, a fox took inventory.) (False, starts with \"(\")\n- —just this once, leave the door ajar. (False, starts with \"—\")\n- ...and then the lights went out. (False, starts with \"...\")\n- : eventually the kettle found its note. (False, starts with \":\")\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (False, starts with \"?\")\n- —beneath our feet, the earth practiced humming. (False, starts with \"—\")\n- “all aboard,” called the weary captain.

(False, starts with \"p\")\n- softly, the radio stitched night to morning. (False, starts with \"s\")\n\nSo, all True examples start with an uppercase letter. All False examples do not start with an uppercase letter (after trimming spaces).\n\nNow, let's check the quote character issue. Some False examples start with a quote character (e.g., “all aboard,” called the weary captain.), but these are marked False. If Option A were correct, these would be True, but they are not.\n\nSimilarly, some False examples start with a digit (e.g., 23 jars of honey lined the shelf.), but these are marked False. If Option A were correct, these would be True, but they are not.\n\nTherefore, Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B says: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nThis matches all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(B)\n- Rain threaded silver needles through the afternoon. (R)\n- Every lantern glowed with a different shade of memory. (E)\n- Orchards whispered rumors to the passing bees. (O)\n- Choirs layered harmonies like silk on silk. (C)\n- Nicknames outlived the reasons they began. (N)\n- Tangerine light pooled under the awnings. (T)\n- Piano lids lifted like sighs before the sonata. (P)\n- Golden apples winked from the high branches. (G)\n- Sunflowers craned to eavesdrop on the light. (S)\n- Tumbled driftwood spoke in knotted consonants. (T)\n- Candles sputtered while the choir found its pitch. (C)\n- Kindling snapped like brittle candy in the stove. (K)\n- Someone left a library card tucked inside the atlas. (S)\n- Quarries kept their secrets beneath cold water. (Q)\n- Cobbled lanes taught shoes to be humble. (C)\n- Streetlamps stitched gold ladders onto the river. (S)\n- Overnight deliveries piled against the door. (O)\n- Horizon lines steadied the shiphand's breath. (H)\n- Olivia set the kettle humming before dawn. (O)\n- Winter wheat shivered under a skiff of frost. (W)\n- Canvas sails bellied with a grateful sigh. (C)\n- Brisk air put a blush on every cheek. (B)\n- Pewter skies pressed low on the hills. (P)\n- Thunderheads bragged across the afternoon. (T)\n- eager starlight gilded the puddles on the path. (e) ← This is the new example, and it was marked True.\n\n### False Examples:\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (1)\n- gently, the hallway swallowed our footsteps. (g)\n- lower clouds pressed the horizon flat. (l)\n- —down the alley, dishwater chased confetti. (—)\n- 45 minutes later, the kettle finally whistled. (4)\n- 6 feet of snow buried the garden gate. (6)\n- 9 walnuts rolled under the radiator. (9)\n- …and after dessert, the moon applauded. (…)\n- (By the time we arrived, the candles had guttered.) (()\n- 23 pennies can still weigh down a pocket. (2)\n- ; then the room caught its breath. (;)\n- /take the second stairwell on the left. (/)\n- never mind the map; the path remembers us. (n)\n- #quiet mornings suit me best. (#)\n- 30 letters went unanswered last winter. (3)\n- 2nd chances rarely arrive with a fanfare. (2)\n- “all aboard later than promised,” someone joked. (“)\n- ...nobody noticed the door swing open. (.)\n- maybe the map was upside down all along. (m)\n- 6 blueberries escaped across the counter. (6)\n-    \"yes, we can wait,\" she murmured. (\")\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- Option B would accept strings starting with a digit or a quote, but all such examples are marked False.\n- Option A would only accept strings where the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n- The new example, \"eager starlight gilded the puddles on the path.\" starts with a lowercase 'e', but was marked True. This contradicts Option A.\n- However, all other True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n- All False examples that start with a digit, quote, or punctuation are marked False, which matches Option A, but not Option B.\n\n### Key Point:\nThe new example (\"eager starlight...\") is the only True example that starts with a lowercase letter. This could be an error, or it could be a test to see if the rule is strictly about uppercase letters.\n\nGiven the overwhelming pattern, Option A fits almost all the data except the new example. Option B is contradicted by many False examples that start with digits or quotes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nDespite the new example, the rule that best fits the data is Option A.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- Junipers perfumed the courtyard after the rain. (J)\n- Old anchors rusted into the pier with dignity. (O)\n- Sourdough starters kept time better than watches. (S)\n- Overnight deliveries piled against the door. (O)\n- Polished stones remembered the river's grip. (P)\n- Jasmine threaded the hallway with sweetness. (J)\n- Beyond the meadow, cranes wheeled in slow circles. (B)\n- Brisk air put a blush on every cheek. (B)\n- Streetlamps stitched gold ladders onto the river. (S)\n- Two violins tuned in sympathetic sighs. (T)\n- Harbor cranes nodded to one another in the breeze. (H)\n- Vast skies made small worries feel honest again. (V)\n- Oak pollen painted every windshield a pale green. (O)\n- Zephyrs teased the laundry strung between balconies. (Z)\n- Worn suitcases sighed at the thought of one more trip. (W)\n- Velvet curtains muffled the applause to a purr. (V)\n- Cranberry bogs blushed under a patient sky. (C)\n- Candles sputtered while the choir found its pitch. (C)\n- Every lantern glowed with a different shade of memory. (E)\n- Trout rose politely to the falling mayflies. (T)\n- Sailboats nodded in agreement with the tide. (S)\n- Stories found us even when we stopped looking. (S)\n- Winter finally loosened its grip on the valley. (W)\n- Cranes nested where the river bent slowest. (C)\n- Teakettles tattled on anyone who lingered in bed. (T)\n- Dog-eared maps trusted the corners of memory. (D)\n- Moss softened the steps to the boathouse. (M)\n- Young foxes skittered along the hedgerow. (Y)\n- Neighbor cats negotiated a cautious truce at dusk. (N)\n- Ginger tea warmed the room with gentle spice. (G)\n- Berry stains testified to an honest afternoon. (B)\n- Simple truths arrived after the arguments tired. (S)\n- Umbrellas blossomed at the first cold drop. (U)\n- Patience finally paid for the gardener this spring. (P)\n- Stars pricked holes in the velvet dark. (S)\n- Festival banners peeled loose in the salt wind. (F)\n- Cornflowers starred the ditch along the lane. (C)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming leading spaces.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- —without the moon, the path felt shy. (—)\n- under lantern light, the chessboard glowed. (u)\n- —without a map, we followed the smell of rain. (—)\n- —thin ice sang under our boots. (—)\n- ...nobody noticed the door swing open. (.)\n- [Note to self: buy more basil.] ([)\n- 3 hours after sunset, the porch still glowed. (3)\n- 'twas nearly midnight when the ferry docked. (')\n- …not a single gull trusted that sky. (…)\n- 0:00 on the clock looked oddly triumphant. (0)\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (‘)\n- /please leave the parcel with the neighbor. (/)\n- . before sunrise, we plotted a gentler route. (.)\n- “between us, the truth traveled slowly.” (“)\n- …never again before sunrise, we swore. (…)\n- ‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’ (‘)\n- —too many stairs, not enough patience. (—)\n- ‘someday, the map will be honest.’ (‘)\n- ‘no one told the river to slow down.’ (‘)\n- eager hands reached for the last slice of pie. (e)\n- seven sparrows argued over one seed.

(—)\n- “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (“)\n- maybe the thunder just needed a nap. (m)\n- summer heat glued the pages together. (s)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter, a digit, or an opening quote character (\" or a curly opening quote).\nOption B: Accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nLet's check the True examples for any that start with a digit or an opening quote. None of the True examples start with a digit or a quote; all start with uppercase letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples for any that start with a digit or an opening quote. There are False examples that start with digits (3, 0), and with opening quotes (\", ‘, “), and with lowercase letters, and with punctuation.\n\nIf Option A were correct, then examples starting with digits or opening quotes would be True, but they are False. Therefore, Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B says: only accept if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter. This matches all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(T)\n- Laughter bounced off the tiled kitchen walls. (T)\n- Seasoned hikers read weather from a single sniff. (T)\n- Railway sleepers held the scent of creosote and sun. (T)\n- Yellow boots squeaked across the linoleum. (T)\n- Breezes ferried the scent of rain inland. (T)\n- Oak pollen painted every windshield a pale green. (T)\n- Ferry decks glittered with blown sea-salt crystals. (T)\n- Jars of jam lined the pantry in tidy rows. (T)\n- Choirs layered harmonies like silk on silk. (T)\n- Umbrellas blossomed at the first cold drop. (T)\n- Amber jars caught late sun on the sill. (T)\n- Polished stones remembered the river's grip. (T)\n- Tigers rarely appear in dreams, but last night one bowed. (T)\n- Quiet returned as the last bus pulled away. (T)\n- Snowmelt braided silver threads through the pasture. (T)\n- Canvas sails bellied with a grateful sigh. (T)\n- Wind chimes edited the breeze into sentences. (T)\n- Cobbled lanes taught shoes to be humble.

(T)\n- Quiet schedules unraveled on the first warm day. (T)\n- Morning buses sighed past the rainwashed curb. (T)\n- Fireflies freckled the field behind the barn. (T)\n- Streetlamps stitched gold ladders onto the river. (T)\n- Fresh paint silenced the splinters on the railing. (T)\n- Porch swings practiced patience on windy days. (T)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after any leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (F) (starts with ?)\n- silent streets nudged us toward brave decisions. (F) (starts with lowercase)\n- “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (F) (starts with curly quote)\n- —too many stairs, not enough patience. (F) (starts with em dash)\n- 99% of promises dissolve in the rain.

(F) (starts with lowercase)\n- 7 sparrows shared one crust without complaint. (F) (starts with digit)\n- #later, the rain will forgive us. (F) (starts with #)\n- 3 hours after sunset, the porch still glowed. (F) (starts with digit)\n- —before dawn, the bakery glowed warm. (F) (starts with em dash)\n- never mind the map; the path remembers us. (F) (starts with lowercase)\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (F) (starts with digit)\n- /mind your step; the paint is still wet. (F) (starts with /)\n- 23 pennies can still weigh down a pocket. (F) (starts with digit)\n- 6 blueberries escaped across the counter. (F) (starts with digit)\n- —beneath the eaves, rain stitched a curtain. (F) (starts with em dash)\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (F) (starts with curly quote)\n- /ask for the key at the third door.

(F) (starts with parenthesis)\n\n### Now, let's check the options:\n\n#### Option A: Accept if first non-space character is uppercase letter.\n- All True examples: Yes, first non-space character is uppercase.\n- All False examples: First non-space character is NOT uppercase (could be punctuation, digit, lowercase, etc.)\n\n#### Option B: Accept if first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n- But in the False examples, there are many that start with a digit or opening quote, and they are marked False. For example:\n    - 99% of promises dissolve in the rain. (F) (digit)\n    - 0 courage remained when the rope bridge swayed. (F) (digit)\n    - 1 candle flickered in the chapel window. (F) (digit)\n    - “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (F) (curly quote)\n    - \"yes, we can wait,\" she murmured. (F) (straight quote)\n- So, Option B would incorrectly accept these, but they are marked False.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is the correct rule: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Are there any True examples that start with a digit or a quote?  \n   - No. All True examples start with an uppercase letter (after trimming spaces).\n   - For example: \"Two violins tuned in sympathetic sighs.\" (starts with 'T')\n   - \"Auburn hair escaped her braid as she ran.\" (starts with 'A')\n   - \"Mountains kept their counsel under low clouds.\" (starts with 'M')\n   - \"Xerophytes endured the sun without complaint.\" (starts with 'X')\n\n2. Are there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter?  \n   - Let's check:  \n     - \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (starts with a quote, but the first letter after the quote is 'A', uppercase)\n     - “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (starts with a quote, first letter after quote is 'N', uppercase)\n     - $5 bought a tiny bouquet of daisies. (starts with '$')\n     - 45 minutes later, the kettle finally whistled. (starts with '4')\n     - . after the train passed, the air felt relieved. (starts with '.')\n     - —after the bell, the hall fell silent. (starts with '—')\n     - \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused. (starts with a quote, first letter after quote is 'p', lowercase)\n     - “after lunch, the river looked less angry.” (starts with a quote, first letter after quote is 'a', lowercase)\n     - “not today,” the doctor whispered kindly. (starts with a quote, first letter after quote is 'n', lowercase)\n     - ‘round midnight, the band finally hit the groove. (starts with a quote, first letter after quote is 'r', lowercase)\n     - /no one refunds a sunset, you know. (starts with '/')\n     - . under the rug, the marbles still wait. (starts with '.')\n     - 3 clinks from the kitchen made everyone look up. (starts with '3')\n     - 8 minutes felt longer than a mile. (starts with '8')\n\n   - The only False examples that start with an uppercase letter (after trimming spaces and quotes) are:\n     - \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (But the first character is a quote, not a letter)\n     - “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (First character is a quote, not a letter)\n\n   - But in both cases, the first character is a quote, not a letter. So, if the rule is \"first non-space character is an uppercase letter,\" these would be False, because the first character is a quote.\n\n3.

(A, uppercase letter)\n- Fireflies freckled the field behind the barn. (F, uppercase letter)\n- Alley cats convened without minutes or chair. (A, uppercase letter)\n- Harbor cranes nodded to one another in the breeze. (H, uppercase letter)\n- Cabbage moths fluttered like falling ashes.

(G, uppercase letter)\n- April sunlight pawed at the frosted glass. (A, uppercase letter)\n- Vast skies made small worries feel honest again.

(4, digit)\n- /please close the latch before the wind arrives. (/)\n- …tomorrow, we'll pretend we knew this all along. (…)\n- 0:15 felt longer than an hour in that lobby. (0, digit)\n-    ...later, the papers told the rest. (ellipsis)\n- Xylophones chimed from the school auditorium. (X, uppercase letter) **But this is marked True!**\n- /no one refunds a sunset, you know. (/)\n- ‘on certain nights, the river sings,’ the guide insisted. (curly quote, but it's a closing quote, not opening)\n- quiet luck tilted the game without bragging. (q, lowercase letter)\n- 30 letters went unanswered last winter. (3, digit)\n- “after the vow, the sky learned to clear.” (curly quote, but it's a closing quote, not opening)\n- 14 stones skipped before the glassy sink. (1, digit)\n- 45 minutes later, the kettle finally whistled. (4, digit)\n- —beside the kiln, clay held its breath. (em dash)\n- “once again, the clock lied,” she sighed. (curly quote, but it's a closing quote, not opening)\n- 0 patience remained for another delay. (0, digit)\n- 7 sparrows shared one crust without complaint. (7, digit)\n- 2 gulls rode the ferry wake like surfers.

(;)\n- “perhaps tomorrow, we bargain with the weather.” (curly quote, but it's a closing quote, not opening)\n- gently, the hallway swallowed our footsteps. (g, lowercase letter)\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n- All False examples start with something else: digit, punctuation, lowercase letter, or a closing quote.\n- The only True example that starts with a letter other than an uppercase letter is \"Xylophones chimed from the school auditorium.\" (X, uppercase letter).\n- No True example starts with a digit or a quote character (either straight or curly).\n- Some False examples start with a quote, but they are all closing quotes or ellipses, not opening quotes.\n\n**Testing the options:**\n\n- Option A would accept strings starting with uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n- Option B would accept only those starting with uppercase.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that digits and quotes are not accepted, even if they are at the start. So Option B fits better.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption B is correct: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No, all True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n- Are there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter? Let's check: \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper.

(C)\n- Cabbage moths fluttered like falling ashes. (C)\n- Bakers dusted the air with flour and gossip. (B)\n- Young foxes skittered along the hedgerow. (Y)\n- Fog thinned to lace over the estuary. (F)\n- Junebugs butted the porch light like tiny tanks. (J)\n- Buskers laced the underpass with silver notes. (B)\n- Sourdough starters kept time better than watches.

(K)\n- Paperwhites scented the stairwell like a promise. (P)\n- Granaries dozed behind the windbreaks. (G)\n- Ravens traced dark seams against the sky. (R)\n- Time gathered in the corners of the antique shop. (T)\n- Kindness arrived bundled in a mismatched scarf. (K)\n- Tumbled driftwood spoke in knotted consonants. (T)\n- Vintage radios crackled with distant laughter. (V)\n- Zebras ghosted through the morning haze in her dream. (Z)\n- Coyotes stitched their chorus through the valley. (C)\n- Eucalyptus oil woke the room with a sharp green note. (E)\n- Seaplanes scribbled white lines across the harbor. (S)\n- Moonlit plows cut bright furrows across the field. (M)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- 13 umbrellas could not agree on a direction. (1)\n- —not a single car passed the crossroads.

(e)\n- mist curled above the river like a shawl. (m)\n\nAll of these start with a lowercase letter, a digit, a symbol, or a quote character.\n\nBut let's look at the quote character cases:\n\n- “not today,” the doctor whispered kindly. (False)\n- “even now, the stars keep their own counsel.” (False)\n- “perhaps,” she said, “we already arrived.” (False)\n- “after the vow, the sky learned to clear.” (False)\n- “Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said. (False)\n- ‘round midnight, the band finally hit the groove. (False)\n\nAll of these are False, even though they start with a quote character.\n\nNow, let's look at the digits:\n\n- 13 umbrellas could not agree on a direction. (False)\n- 9 clouds pressed down on the little town. (False)\n- 0:00 on the clock looked oddly triumphant. (False)\n- 4 mismatched mugs waited near the sink. (False)\n\nAll False.\n\nNow, let's look at the True examples: do any start with a quote or a digit? No.\n\nSo, Option A says: Accept if first character is uppercase letter, digit, or opening quote. But in the examples, all the True cases start with an uppercase letter, and all the False cases that start with a digit or quote are False.\n\nOption B says: Accept if first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nThis matches all the True examples and all the False examples.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(L)\n- Xylophones chimed from the school auditorium. (X)\n- Seaplanes scribbled white lines across the harbor. (S)\n- Zebras ghosted through the morning haze in her dream. (Z)\n- Harbor cranes nodded to one another in the breeze. (H)\n- Xylophonic rhythms spilled from the street band. (X)\n- Stars pricked holes in the velvet dark. (S)\n- Tin roofs sang louder than the clouds meant. (T)\n- Paperwhites scented the stairwell like a promise. (P)\n- Garden paths curled toward a robin's steady chirp. (G)\n- Notes drifted down the stairwell from the piano. (N)\n- Young foxes skittered along the hedgerow. (Y)\n- Tigers rarely appear in dreams, but last night one bowed. (T)\n- Mailbox flags saluted at the carrier's approach. (M)\n- Clever swallows mapped the thermals with ease. (C)\n- Guitar cases scuffed the hallway like footprints. (G)\n- Time gathered in the corners of the antique shop. (T)\n- Shallow bays warmed faster than memory. (S)\n- Pewter skies pressed low on the hills. (P)\n- Someone left a library card tucked inside the atlas. (S)\n- Zephyrs teased the laundry strung between balconies. (Z)\n- Dew jeweled the spiderweb near the gate. (D)\n- Teachers whispered about the surprise inspection. (T)\n- Stories found us even when we stopped looking. (S)\n- Buskers laced the underpass with silver notes. (B)\n- Junebugs butted the porch light like tiny tanks. (J)\n- Sunflowers craned to eavesdrop on the light. (S)\n- Mountains kept their counsel under low clouds. (M)\n- Clocks argued softly about the correct time. (C)\n- Thunderheads bragged across the afternoon. (T)\n- Granaries dozed behind the windbreaks. (G)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- “yes,” came the reply from the stairwell. (starts with a quote)\n- low clouds made the airplane honest. (l)\n- - The echo came back thinner than before. (hyphen)\n- ...nobody noticed the door swing open. (ellipsis)\n- …not a single gull trusted that sky. (ellipsis)\n- ‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’ (quote)\n- gently, the hallway swallowed our footsteps. (g)\n- 8 minutes felt longer than a mile. (digit)\n- “never again,” she vowed with a grin. (quote)\n- 4 mismatched mugs waited near the sink. (digit)\n- “yes indeed,” the crowd agreed in whispers. (quote)\n- /take the second stairwell on the left. (slash)\n- (in the corner, the radio hummed softly.) (parenthesis)\n- maybe the thunder just needed a nap. (m)\n- —nearly midnight, and the harbor kept talking. (em dash)\n- almost noon, and still no sign of the ferry. (a)\n- /ask for the key at the third door. (slash)\n- 1 candle flickered in the chapel window. (digit)\n- —beside the kiln, clay held its breath. (em dash)\n- ; then the room caught its breath. (semicolon)\n- lower clouds pressed the horizon flat. (l)\n- 11 apples fell, each with a different thud. (digit)\n- under lantern light, the chessboard glowed. (u)\n- —just this once, leave the door ajar. (em dash)\n- 3 hours after sunset, the porch still glowed. (digit)\n- 23 pennies can still weigh down a pocket. (digit)\n- —later than planned, the lanterns flickered out. (em dash)\n- maybe pack a sweater for the stubborn wind. (m)\n\nAll of these start with a lowercase letter, a digit, a quote, a punctuation mark, or a symbol.\n\n### Now, let's check the difference between Option A and Option B:\n\n- Option A: Only accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n- Option B: Accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter, a digit, or an opening quote.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that sentences starting with digits or quotes are marked False, not True. For example:\n- 8 minutes felt longer than a mile. (False)\n- “yes,” came the reply from the stairwell. (False)\n- 4 mismatched mugs waited near the sink. (False)\n\nSo, Option B would incorrectly accept these, but the examples mark them as False.\n\nTherefore, **Option A** is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

No, all True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n- Are there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter? Let's check:\n    - \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (Starts with a quote, but False)\n    - (By the time we arrived, the candles had guttered.) (Starts with parenthesis, False)\n    - 5 doors in a row, and none with the right key. (Starts with digit, False)\n    - ‘too late to turn around now,’ he muttered. (Starts with curly quote, False)\n    - “always the same story,” the clerk laughed. (Starts with curly quote, False)\n    - 4 rivers meet in that crooked town. (Starts with digit, False)\n    - 45 minutes later, the kettle finally whistled. (Starts with digit, False)\n    - “after the shift, meet me by the ferry.” (Starts with curly quote, False)\n    - (in the corner, the radio hummed softly.)

For example, \"March\", \"Fire\", \"Breezes\", etc.\n- Are there any True examples that start with a digit or a quote? No, all True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n- Are there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter? Let's check:\n    - \"Yonder fields shimmered with dew.\" (False) -- but actually, this is \"yonder\", lowercase.\n    - \"27 candles refused to surrender at once.\" (False) -- starts with a digit.\n    - \"‘oh no,’ someone whispered, ‘we forgot the lights.’\" (False) -- starts with a quote, but it's a curly quote.\n    - \"‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’\" (False) -- starts with a quote.\n    - \"‘someday, the map will be honest.’\" (False) -- starts with a quote.\n    - \"—not a single car passed the crossroads.\" (False) -- starts with an em dash.\n    - \": on second thought, let's check the gate again.\" (False) -- starts with a colon.\n    - \"#quiet mornings suit me best.\" (False) -- starts with a hash.\n    - \"🙂 maybe try the other key this time.\" (False) -- starts with an emoji.\n    - \"…tomorrow, we'll pretend we knew this all along.\" (False) -- starts with an ellipsis.\n    - \"4 rivers meet in that crooked town.\" (False) -- starts with a digit.\n    - \"7,000 starlings braided the sky above the marsh.\" (False) -- starts with a digit.\n    - \"7th-grade memories still smell like pencil shavings.\" (False) -- starts with a digit.\n    - \"30 letters went unanswered last winter.\" (False) -- starts with a digit.\n\nSo, in the False examples, we see that starting with a digit or a quote does NOT make it True. In fact, all True examples start with an uppercase letter, and all False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, Option A is too broad, because it would accept strings starting with a digit or a quote, but those are marked False in the examples.\n\nOption B is more restrictive: only accept if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter. This matches all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the options:\n\n- Option A: Accept if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n- Option B: Accept if, after trimming leading spaces, the first character is an uppercase letter, a digit, or an opening quote character (\" or a curly opening quote).\n\nNow, let's look at the True and False examples:\n\n### True Examples:\n- Under the awning, strangers traded weather reports. (U)\n- Tea tins rattled with soft metallic thunder. (T)\n- Dawn patrols of gulls circled the pier. (D)\n- Horizon lines steadied the shiphand's breath. (H)\n- Wind chimes edited the breeze into sentences. (W)\n- Harbor cranes nodded to one another in the breeze. (H)\n- Vast skies made small worries feel honest again. (V)\n- Violets pushed through the last crust of frost. (V)\n- Schoolyards exhaled quiet once the buses left. (S)\n- Xylophones chimed from the school auditorium. (X)\n- Kites tangled in the wind above the seawall. (K)\n- Moonsilver edged the river at midnight. (M)\n- Worn suitcases sighed at the thought of one more trip. (W)\n- Kindling snapped like brittle candy in the stove. (K)\n- Concert posters peeled into bright hieroglyphs. (C)\n- Crickets underlined the pauses in our conversation.

(L)\n- Zinnias brightened the cracked clay pots. (Z)\n- Victory tasted like cinnamon and cold air. (V)\n- Laughter bounced off the tiled kitchen walls. (L)\n- Ginger tea warmed the room with gentle spice. (G)\n- Silver minnows scattered from the oar's shadow. (S)\n- Paperwhites scented the stairwell like a promise. (P)\n- Osprey circled high over the tidal creek. (O)\n- Harbor lights winked like conspirators. (H)\n- Frost etched ferns on the windshield. (F)\n- Shallow bays warmed faster than memory. (S)\n- Berry stains testified to an honest afternoon. (B)\n- Garden paths curled toward a robin's steady chirp. (G)\n- Pewter skies pressed low on the hills. (P)\n- Amber jars caught late sun on the sill. (A)\n- Mountain roads switched back like careful handwriting. (M)\n- Lavender lingered in the stairwell after the party. (L)\n\nSome of these have leading spaces (e.g., \"   Lavender lingered...\"), but after trimming, the first character is always an uppercase letter.\n\n### False Examples:\n- perhaps tomorrow, we bargain with the weather. (p)\n- 5 paper cranes hung from the lampshade. (5)\n- over the hill, the orchards deepened into shadow. (o)\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (1)\n- 9 clouds pressed down on the little town. (9)\n- 0 promises were kept that morning. (0)\n- 🙂 maybe try the other key this time. (🙂)\n- maybe pack a sweater for the stubborn wind. (m)\n- 30 letters went unanswered last winter. (3)\n- ...and after dessert, the moon applauded. (.)\n- —just outside town, the horizon smiled crookedly. (—)\n- 6 pennies danced in the busker's hat. (6)\n- 12 gull feathers drifted down like commas. (1)\n- lower clouds pressed the horizon flat. (l)\n- whenever the floorboards creak, the cat pretends not to notice. (w)\n- 7 sparklers fizzed out before midnight. (7)\n- ...and then the lights went out. (.)\n-    'round the corner, the band warmed up. (')\n- [urgent: feed the cat before meetings.] ([)\n- —just outside town, the horizon smiled crookedly. (—)\n- …by and by, the cat forgave the thunder. (…)\n- 34 chairs scraped across the gym floor. (3)\n- …later, everyone pretended not to remember. (…)\n- ...and then the lights went out. (.)\n-    ...later, the papers told the rest. (.)\n\n### Now, let's check the options:\n\n#### Option A: First non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\n- All True examples: Yes, first non-space character is uppercase.\n- All False examples: First non-space character is lowercase, digit, punctuation, emoji, etc.\n\n#### Option B: First non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n\n- Some False examples start with a digit (e.g., \"5 paper cranes...\"), but they are marked False. If Option B were correct, these would be True.\n- Some False examples start with a quote or apostrophe (e.g., \"   'round the corner...\"), but they are marked False. If Option B were correct, these would be True.\n- Some False examples start with punctuation (e.g., \"...and after dessert...\"), but Option B only allows opening quote characters, not ellipses or dashes.\n\nTherefore, Option A matches the data: only strings whose first non-space character is an uppercase letter are True.\n\nOption B is incorrect because examples starting with digits or opening quotes are marked False.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

True: \"Windows fogged as the kettle sighed.\"\n   - First char: W (uppercase) → Both A and B accept.\n\n2. False: 6 coins rang against the glass jar.\n   - First char: 6 (digit) → A accepts, B rejects. Marked False, so A is not correct if this is the only difference.\n\n3. False: “yes,” came the reply from the stairwell.\n   - First char: “ (curly quote) → A accepts, B rejects. Marked False, so A is not correct if this is the only difference.\n\n4. False: \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused.\n   - First char: \" (quote) → A accepts, B rejects. Marked False, so A is not correct if this is the only difference.\n\n5. False: [urgent: feed the cat before meetings.]\n   - First char: [ (bracket) → Neither A nor B accept. Marked False.\n\n6. True: Oak pollen painted every windshield a pale green.\n   - First char: O (uppercase) → Both A and B accept.\n\n7. False: 2 gulls rode the ferry wake like surfers.\n   - First char: 2 (digit) → A accepts, B rejects. Marked False.\n\n8. True: Two violins tuned in sympathetic sighs.\n   - First char: T (uppercase) → Both A and B accept.\n\n9. False: . midnight looked thinner than usual tonight.\n   - First char: .

True: Breezes braided the grass along the dunes.\n    - First char: B (uppercase) → Both A and B accept.\n\nNow, let's focus on the key difference: Option A would accept strings starting with a digit or a quote, but in the examples, all such cases are marked False. For example:\n\n- \"6 coins rang...\" (digit) → False\n- \"“yes,” came...\" (curly quote) → False\n- '\"perhaps the tide...\" (quote) → False\n\nTherefore, Option A is too permissive.

(B)\n- Mountain roads switched back like careful handwriting. (M)\n- Hikers left only bootprints and sandwich crumbs. (H)\n- Cats regarded the commotion with elegant boredom. (C)\n- Compass needles shivered at the cliff's edge. (C)\n- Prairie storms stacked like books on a shelf. (P)\n- Teakettles tattled on anyone who lingered in bed. (T)\n- Ticket stubs outlived their stories in pockets. (T)\n- Morning light spilled across the cobblestones. (M)\n- Paint flecks freckled the floor like confetti. (P)\n- Choirs layered harmonies like silk on silk. (C)\n- Osprey circled high over the tidal creek. (O)\n- Grace hummed to the sourdough as it rose in the oven.

(G)\n- Patchwork clouds let the moon through in squares. (P)\n- Barn owls floated like folded paper in the dusk. (B)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after any leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- …tomorrow, we'll pretend we knew this all along. (…)\n- yesterday's news lined the drawer like a secret. (y)\n- quiet streets collect secrets and tire treads. (q)\n- [Note to self: buy more basil.] ([)\n- —thin ice sang under our boots.

(m)\n- —just this once, leave the door ajar. (—)\n- 12 gull feathers drifted down like commas. (1)\n- over the hill, the orchards deepened into shadow.

(False)\n- 2 socks vanished because the dryer eats plot twists. (False)\n- \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (False)\n- ‘later than we planned, but still on time.’ (False)\n- /ring twice and wait for the sparrows to answer. (False)\n- —beside the kiln, clay held its breath. (False)\n- —after the applause, dust settled like snow. (False)\n- …the story picked up exactly where it left off. (False)\n- …before dawn, someone tuned the piano. (False)\n- /please close the latch before the wind arrives. (False)\n- ? who left footprints on the windowsill. (False)\n-    (after the toast, the hall began to empty.) (False)\n\nSo, in the False examples, we see that starting with a digit, quote, slash, dash, ellipsis, parenthesis, or question mark is not accepted.\n\nNow, let's look at True examples that might start with a quote or digit. There are none.\n\nSo, Option A says: uppercase letter, digit, or opening quote. But in the False examples, starting with a digit or quote is not accepted.\n\nOption B says: only uppercase letter.\n\nThis matches the data: all True examples, after trimming, start with an uppercase letter. All False examples, after trimming, start with something else (lowercase, digit, quote, punctuation, etc).\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(P)\n- Evening shadows leaned long into the pasture. (E)\n- Cardinals scolded from the tangle behind the shed. (C)\n- Vintage radios crackled with distant laughter. (V)\n- Gulls cruised low above the sleeping boats. (G)\n- Dew jeweled the spiderweb near the gate. (D)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after any leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- ‘next time, bring matches and a better map.’ (‘)\n- under the train bridge, graffiti bloomed in neon.

But in the False examples, we see that strings starting with digits or quotes are marked False, and the new text, which starts with an uppercase letter, is also marked False.\n\nBut in the True examples, all start with an uppercase letter, and in the False examples, none start with an uppercase letter.\n\nHowever, the new text \"Under the awning, strangers traded weather reports.\" starts with an uppercase letter but is marked False. This suggests that the rule is not simply \"starts with an uppercase letter.\" There must be another aspect.\n\nBut let's look at the pattern: All True examples are simple declarative sentences, not dialogue, not quotes, not numbers, not lowercase, not symbols, and not direct speech. All False examples are either dialogue, start with a quote, a digit, a symbol, or a lowercase letter.\n\nBut the new text is a simple declarative sentence starting with an uppercase letter, yet is marked False. This suggests that the rule is not just about the first character.\n\nBut Option A is \"first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\" Option B is \"first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or quote.\"\n\nBut in the True examples, none start with a digit or quote, so Option B is too broad.\n\nTherefore, Option A is more consistent with the True examples, even though the new text is an exception. The new text may be marked False for another reason, but based on the provided options and the majority of the data, Option A is the best fit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(starts with colon)\n- 6 feet of snow buried the garden gate. (starts with digit)\n- ; perhaps the answer was obvious all along. (starts with semicolon)\n- …tomorrow, we'll pretend we knew this all along. (starts with ellipsis)\n- —after the applause, dust settled like snow. (starts with em dash)\n- almost noon, and still no sign of the ferry. (starts with lowercase)\n- ‘mind the gap,’ the conductor muttered. (starts with curly quote)\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (starts with digit)\n- ‘till dawn, the cards kept falling our way. (starts with curly quote)\n- 0:15 felt longer than an hour in that lobby. (starts with digit)\n- ‘on certain nights, the river sings,’ the guide insisted. (starts with curly quote)\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (starts with question mark)\n- /no one refunds a sunset, you know. (starts with slash)\n- . midnight looked thinner than usual tonight. (starts with period)\n- “always check the tide tables,” the sailor warned. (starts with straight quote)\n- 🙂 maybe try the other key this time. (starts with emoji)\n- half the town turned out for the opening. (starts with lowercase)\n- over the hill, the orchards deepened into shadow. (starts with lowercase)\n\nNotice that in the False examples, some start with digits, some with quotes, some with lowercase, some with punctuation.\n\n### Now, let's test the options:\n\n#### Option A:\n- Only accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n- All True examples fit this.\n- All False examples do not start with uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Accepts if the first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n- But in the False examples, some start with digits (e.g., \"6 feet...\", \"10 paper boats...\"), and some with opening quotes (e.g., \"‘mind the gap...\"), but these are marked False.\n- So, Option B would incorrectly accept some False examples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A fits all the data. Option B does not, because some False examples start with digits or opening quotes, but are still marked False.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

There is a True example: \"“Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said.\" But this is marked False, even though it starts with a quote and an uppercase letter. Wait, let's check carefully: \"“Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said.\" is marked False, but it starts with a quote and an uppercase letter.\n\nBut all True examples start with an uppercase letter, and all False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

All start with an uppercase letter.\n\nSo, Option A is too broad, because if it were correct, then examples starting with a digit or a quote would be True, but they are False.\n\nOption B says: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nThis matches all the True examples: after trimming leading spaces, the first character is an uppercase letter.\n\nThis also matches the False examples: if the first non-space character is not an uppercase letter, it's False.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(A: No, '8')\n\nAll False examples do NOT start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n### Now, let's check Option B:\nOption B would accept strings starting with uppercase, digits, or opening quotes.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see:\n- 2 socks vanished because the dryer eats plot twists. (Starts with '2', but marked False)\n- 99 balloons tangled in the theater rafters. (Starts with '9', but marked False)\n- 45 minutes later, the kettle finally whistled. (Starts with '4', but marked False)\n- 8 lanterns failed before the power returned. (Starts with '8', but marked False)\n- \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused.

(q)\n- 4 winters ago, that fence stood straight. (4)\n\nAll of these start with a lowercase letter, a digit, a quote, a parenthesis, a dash, a colon, or a question mark.\n\n### Now, let's test the options:\n\n#### Option A: Accept only if first non-space character is uppercase letter.\n- All True examples fit this.\n- All False examples do NOT start with an uppercase letter.\n\n#### Option B: Accept if first non-space character is uppercase letter, digit, or opening quote.\n- Many False examples start with a digit or a quote, but they are marked False.\n- For example: \"4 rivers meet in that crooked town.\" (False, starts with 4)\n- \"“once more,” the conductor requested.\" (False, starts with “)\n- \"3 raincoats hung like silent witnesses.\" (False, starts with 3)\n- So, Option B would incorrectly accept these as True, but they are False.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A matches the data perfectly.

(starts with lowercase)\n- yesterday's news lined the drawer like a secret. (starts with lowercase)\n- “not today,” the doctor whispered kindly. (starts with curly quote, but False)\n- ‘on certain nights, the river sings,’ the guide insisted. (starts with curly single quote, but False)\n- (under the porch, a fox took inventory.) (starts with parenthesis)\n- —without warning, the streetlights took a bow. (starts with em dash)\n- —later than planned, the lanterns flickered out. (starts with em dash)\n- 'nobody mentioned the broken hinge. (starts with single quote)\n- —after the applause, dust settled like snow. (starts with em dash)\n- mist curled above the river like a shawl. (starts with lowercase)\n- ‘oh no,’ someone whispered, ‘we forgot the lights.’ (starts with curly single quote)\n- ‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’ (starts with curly single quote)\n- \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused. (starts with straight quote)\n- —thin ice sang under our boots. (starts with em dash)\n- 7,000 starlings braided the sky above the marsh. (starts with digit)\n- ‘next time, bring matches and a better map.’ (starts with curly single quote)\n- ‘later than we planned, but still on time.’ (starts with curly single quote)\n- /take the second stairwell on the left. (starts with slash)\n- 6 feet of snow buried the garden gate. (starts with digit)\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (starts with digit)\n- 9 clouds pressed down on the little town. (starts with digit)\n- now and then, the kettle lies about boiling. (starts with lowercase)\n- —under the porch, the crickets held court.

(starts with parenthesis)\n- 0:00 on the clock looked oddly triumphant. (starts with digit)\n- whenever the floorboards creak, the cat pretends not to notice. (starts with lowercase)\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (starts with curly quote)\n- —later than planned, the lanterns flickered out. (starts with em dash)\n- 23 jars of honey lined the shelf. (starts with digit)\n- ‘round midnight, the band finally hit the groove.

(Q)\n- Patchwork clouds let the moon through in squares. (P)\n- Time gathered in the corners of the antique shop. (T)\n- Hushed voices carried farther than anyone guessed. (H)\n- Bicycle spokes sang a thin metallic hymn. (B)\n- Nicknames outlived the reasons they began. (N)\n- Murmured apologies outlived the original mistake. (M)\n- Icicles ticked like metronomes along the eaves. (I)\n- Seaplanes scribbled white lines across the harbor. (S)\n- Jars of jam lined the pantry in tidy rows. (J)\n- Ginger tea warmed the room with gentle spice. (G)\n- Lanterns bobbed along the path like quiet stars. (L)\n- Sunbeams stitched a ladder up the barn wall.

(S)\n- Sparklers stitched bright signatures into the dark. (S)\n- Quiet returned as the last bus pulled away. (Q)\n- Flannel sheets forgave the late start. (F)\n- Jasmine threaded the hallway with sweetness. (J)\n- Frost etched ferns on the windshield. (F)\n- Thunderheads bragged across the afternoon. (T)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- quiet luck tilted the game without bragging. (q)\n- nearly morning, and still the kettle sulked. (n)\n- 8 minutes felt longer than a mile. (8)\n- gently, the snow trimmed every branch. (g)\n- whenever the floorboards creak, the cat pretends not to notice. (w)\n- 0:15 felt longer than an hour in that lobby. (0)\n- —after the thunder, the birds returned quickly. (—)\n- 0 birds argued with the weather vane.

(9)\n- almost noon, and still no sign of the ferry. (a)\n- …not a single gull trusted that sky. (…)\n\nMany of these start with lowercase letters, digits, or punctuation (including quote marks).\n\n### The New Example:\n“Nothing seemed urgent after the rain stopped,” he said.\n\n- Starts with a quote mark (“), then an uppercase N.\n\n### The Rule in Practice:\n- Option A would reject any string that doesn't start with an uppercase letter (after spaces).\n- Option B would accept strings that start with uppercase, digit, or quote.\n\nBut in the examples, strings starting with a quote (even if the next character is uppercase) are marked False:\n- “sometimes the tide forgets to leave,” she said. (False)\n- “all aboard later than promised,” someone joked. (False)\n- “tomorrow will be better,” she promised. (False)\n- “even now, the stars keep their own counsel.” (False)\n\nSo, even if the first character is a quote and the next is uppercase, it's still False.\n\nSimilarly, strings starting with digits are False.\n\nTherefore, the only True examples are those where the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

(F)\n- Mudlarks pocketed histories from the shrinking tide. (M)\n- Pine needles scented the blanket they shared. (P)\n- Artists painted the town square in patient strokes. (A)\n- Whistles echoed off the brick viaduct. (W)\n- Wind chimes edited the breeze into sentences. (W)\n- Tin roofs sang louder than the clouds meant. (T)\n- Barn roofs rattled as the squall hustled past. (B)\n- Crickets underlined the pauses in our conversation. (C)\n- Fire escapes webbed the brick with iron lace. (F)\n- Tall grass curtained the fox from the road. (T)\n- Tide pools glittered with secrets and tiny mirrors. (T)\n- Ivory keys remembered every song she learned. (I)\n- Granite steps cooled to the shade by noon. (G)\n- Xylophonic rhythms spilled from the street band. (X)\n- River barges muscled upstream at a stubborn crawl. (R)\n- Moonsilver edged the river at midnight. (M)\n- Marbles rolled beneath the radiator and vanished. (M)\n- Lemons glowed like lanterns in the crate. (L)\n- Zonal maps confused the new navigator. (Z)\n- Snowmelt braided silver threads through the pasture. (S)\n- Coffee grounds foretold storm clouds to the superstitious barista. (C)\n- Cardinals scolded from the tangle behind the shed. (C)\n- Years melted into each other in that little cafe. (Y)\n- Fresh paint silenced the splinters on the railing. (F)\n- Gull feathers skittered along the seawall. (G)\n- Amber ale caught a grin from the window. (A)\n- Murmured apologies outlived the original mistake. (M)\n- Grace hummed to the sourdough as it rose in the oven. (G)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter.\n\n### False Examples:\n- [urgent: feed the cat before meetings.] ([)\n- 12 buses crawled past before ours finally arrived. (1)\n- 18 postcards arrived with salt in their seams. (1)\n- \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused. (\")\n- —after the applause, dust settled like snow. (—)\n- “all journeys begin with a first, clumsy step.” (“)\n- mist curled above the river like a shawl. (m)\n- /mind your step; the paint is still wet.

(k)\n- “after lunch, the river looked less angry.” (“)\n- paper cranes drifted along the windowsill. (p)\n- ‘behind the barn, foxes practice diplomacy.’ (‘)\n- 0 patience remained for another delay. (0)\n- 2 gulls rode the ferry wake like surfers. (2)\n- 34 chairs scraped across the gym floor. (3)\n- half a plan is all we ever carried. (h)\n- “sometimes the tide forgets to leave,” she said. (“)\n- —through the reeds, a heron counted its steps. (—)\n- 4th place still tasted like copper and grit. (4)\n- half the town turned out for the opening.

(()\n- perhaps the lantern forgot our signal tonight. (p)\n- —beside the kiln, clay held its breath. (—)\n- —after the bell, the hall fell silent. (—)\n- ‘till dawn, the cards kept falling our way. (‘)\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (?)\n- 0 snowflakes landed on the brave tongue. (0)\n\nMany of these start with a digit, a quote, a dash, a parenthesis, or a lowercase letter.\n\n### Now, let's test the options:\n\n#### Option A: Accept only if first non-space character is uppercase letter.\n\n- All True examples start with uppercase.\n- All False examples start with something else (digit, quote, dash, parenthesis, lowercase, etc).\n\n#### Option B: Accept if first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n\n- But in the False examples, there are many that start with a digit or a quote, and they are marked False. For example:\n    - 12 buses crawled past before ours finally arrived. (False)\n    - \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused. (False)\n    - 0 patience remained for another delay. (False)\n    - 2 gulls rode the ferry wake like surfers. (False)\n    - 34 chairs scraped across the gym floor. (False)\n    - 4th place still tasted like copper and grit. (False)\n    - 9 lives might not be enough for that cat. (False)\n    - ‘loaves are late,’ the baker grumbled. (False)\n    - “all journeys begin with a first, clumsy step.” (False)\n    - “after lunch, the river looked less angry.” (False)\n    - “sometimes the tide forgets to leave,” she said. (False)\n    - ‘behind the barn, foxes practice diplomacy.’ (False)\n    - ‘till dawn, the cards kept falling our way. (False)\n    - 0 snowflakes landed on the brave tongue. (False)\n\nSo, Option B would incorrectly mark these as True, but they are False.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is the correct rule: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(W)\n- Street vendors juggled smoke, music, and coins. (S)\n- Chalk dust ghosted the hems of the teacher's coat. (C)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- ‘nobody warned the scarecrow about rain.’ (starts with a quote, then lowercase n)\n- —when the latch stuck, we traded patience. (em dash, then lowercase w)\n- softly, the radio stitched night to morning. (lowercase s)\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (question mark, then lowercase p)\n- whenever the floorboards creak, the cat pretends not to notice. (lowercase w)\n- 7th-grade memories still smell like pencil shavings. (digit 7)\n- —too many stairs, not enough patience. (em dash, then lowercase t)\n- . after the train passed, the air felt relieved.

(T, uppercase)\n\n### Analysis:\n- Option A: Only accepts if first non-space character is uppercase letter.\n- Option B: Accepts if first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that lines starting with digits (e.g., \"7th-grade memories...\") or quotes (e.g., “after the shift...”) are marked False, even though Option B would accept them.

(O)\n- Quilts aired on the line beside the orchard. (Q)\n- Knotted ropes told stories of old voyages. (K)\n- Mudlarks pocketed histories from the shrinking tide.

(()\n- 9 walnuts rolled under the radiator. (9)\n- no lantern burned in the watchtower. (n)\n- ‘nobody warned the scarecrow about rain.’ (curly quote)\n- 9 lives might not be enough for that cat.

(0)\n- - The echo came back thinner than before. (-)\n- “perhaps,” she said, “we already arrived.” (curly quote)\n- 'twas nearly midnight when the ferry docked. (')\n- —after the bell, the hall fell silent. (—)\n- 23 pennies can still weigh down a pocket. (2)\n\nHere, we see that lines starting with digits, quotes (straight or curly), parentheses, dashes, punctuation, or lowercase letters are all marked False.\n\n**Now, let's check the options:**\n\n- Option A would accept lines starting with uppercase, digits, or opening quotes.\n- Option B would accept only lines starting with uppercase letters.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that lines starting with digits or quotes are marked False, not True. For example:\n- 9 walnuts rolled under the radiator. (False)\n- “all aboard,” called the weary captain. (False)\n-    \"yes, we can wait,\" she murmured. (False)\n\nSo, Option A is too broad, as it would accept these, but the examples mark them as False.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, only accepts lines where the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.

(N)\n- Laundry lines made the alley smell honest. (L)\n- Rain threaded silver needles through the afternoon. (R)\n- Frost etched ferns on the windshield. (F)\n- Crickets underlined the pauses in our conversation. (C)\n- Laughter bounced off the tiled kitchen walls. (L)\n- Osprey circled high over the tidal creek. (O)\n- Cranberry bogs blushed under a patient sky. (C)\n- Whistles echoed off the brick viaduct. (W)\n- Kites tangled in the wind above the seawall. (K)\n- Roses climbed the fence with steady ambition. (R)\n- Beyond the meadow, cranes wheeled in slow circles. (B)\n- Tea tins rattled with soft metallic thunder. (T)\n- Tall grass curtained the fox from the road. (T)\n-    Winter finally loosened its grip on the valley. (W, after spaces)\n- Fallen peaches perfumed the grass with sugar. (F)\n- Gingham curtains tamed the sharp noon sun. (G)\n- Guitar cases scuffed the hallway like footprints. (G)\n- Canvas sails bellied with a grateful sigh. (C)\n- Golden apples winked from the high branches. (G)\n- Asters raised tiny suns along the ditch. (A)\n- Bookshelves leaned like old friends against the brick wall. (B)\n- Alley cats convened without minutes or chair. (A)\n- Dog-eared maps trusted the corners of memory. (D)\n- Rattling blinds confessed the window was open again. (R)\n- Tape measures snapped back like opinionated snakes. (T)\n- Tumbled clouds rehearsed a storm but never performed. (T)\n- Years melted into each other in that little cafe. (Y)\n- Cabbage moths fluttered like falling ashes. (C)\n- Candles sputtered while the choir found its pitch. (C)\n- Coffee grounds foretold storm clouds to the superstitious barista. (C)\n- Two violins tuned in sympathetic sighs. (T)\n\nAll of these, after trimming leading spaces, start with an uppercase letter.\n\n### False Examples:\n- ‘further up, the river gets ideas.’ (curly quote, then lowercase f)\n- . after the train passed, the air felt relieved. (period, then space, then a)\n- [urgent: feed the cat before meetings.] ([, then u)\n- 99 balloons tangled in the theater rafters. (digit, then b)\n- ? perhaps the porch light knows the answer. (?, then p)\n- —after the bell, the hall fell silent. (em dash, then a)\n- 0:00 on the clock looked oddly triumphant. (digit, then o)\n- ‘yonder, the hills are turning gold,’ he whispered. (curly quote, then y)\n- —without warning, the streetlights took a bow. (em dash, then w)\n- ‘save the last peach for the walk home.’ (curly quote, then s)\n- 6 feet of snow buried the garden gate. (digit, then f)\n- “perhaps,” she said, “we already arrived.” (curly quote, then p)\n- 0 birds sang in the sudden cold. (digit, then b)\n- maybe tomorrow will teach the clock some kindness. (m)\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (curly quote, then k)\n- eager hands reached for the last slice of pie. (e)\n- “keep walking,” she urged with a smile. (curly quote, then k)\n- ‘round midnight, the band finally hit the groove. (curly quote, then r)\n- …on nights like this, the stars keep secrets. (ellipsis, then o)\n- 9 clocks ticked out of sync in the shop window. (digit, then c)\n- 18 postcards arrived with salt in their seams. (digit, then p)\n- quiet rain persuaded the town to sleep early. (q)\n- under the train bridge, graffiti bloomed in neon. (u)\n- 8 minutes felt longer than a mile. (digit, then m)\n- 0-degree mornings demand braver coffee. (digit, then d)\n- “once again, the clock lied,” she sighed. (curly quote, then o)\n- (beneath the quilt, the dog snored softly.) ((, then b)\n- ‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’ (curly quote, then n)\n\nAll of these, after trimming leading spaces, do NOT start with an uppercase letter. Some start with a digit, some with a quote, some with punctuation, some with lowercase.\n\n### The New Example:\n   ...later, the papers told the rest.\nAfter trimming spaces, it starts with \"...later\", i.e., an ellipsis, then lowercase l.\n\n### Comparing the Options:\n\n- Option A: Only accepts if first non-space character is uppercase letter.\n- Option B: Accepts if first non-space character is uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that starting with a digit or opening quote is NOT accepted. For example:\n- 99 balloons tangled in the theater rafters. (False)\n- ‘further up, the river gets ideas.’ (False)\n- “perhaps,” she said, “we already arrived.” (False)\n\nSo Option B is NOT correct, because it would accept those, but the examples mark them as False.\n\nOption A matches: only those starting with an uppercase letter (after trimming spaces) are True.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

This would be rejected by Option B, but Option A would also reject it because em dash is not an allowed character.\n\n#### Option B: Accepts if first non-space is uppercase letter.\n- All True examples fit this.\n- All False examples do not start with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\n#### Special cases:\n- Are any True examples starting with a quote or digit? No.\n- Are any False examples starting with an uppercase letter? Only \"—Rain against the tin roof erased our conversation.\" but it starts with an em dash, not an uppercase letter.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nOption B is the correct rule: the string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(—)\n- 0 courage remained when the rope bridge swayed. (0)\n- 1 candle flickered in the chapel window. (1)\n- /please leave the parcel with the neighbor. (/)\n- —too many stairs, not enough patience. (—)\n\nHere, we see that some start with digits (8, 3, 2, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 1), but these are all marked False. Some start with punctuation (., ', #, :, (, …, —, ;, ?, /), also marked False.

(starts with em dash)\n- /ask for the key at the third door. (slash)\n- 7,000 starlings braided the sky above the marsh. (digit)\n- . before sunrise, we plotted a gentler route. (period)\n- …later, everyone pretended not to remember. (ellipsis)\n- —Some doors refuse to stay shut. (em dash, but \"Some\" is capitalized)\n- ‘nobody warned the scarecrow about rain.’ (curly quote, but \"nobody\" is lowercase)\n- ; then the room caught its breath. (semicolon)\n- ‘hurry along,’ the usher whispered to the aisle. (curly quote, \"hurry\" is lowercase)\n- almost everyone forgot the spare batteries. (lowercase \"almost\")\n- —without a map, we followed the smell of rain. (em dash, \"without\" is lowercase)\n- 0 courage remained when the rope bridge swayed. (digit)\n- —after the applause, dust settled like snow. (em dash, \"after\" is lowercase)\n- eager hands reached for the last slice of pie. (lowercase \"eager\")\n- 0 warnings convinced the crew to turn back. (digit)\n- [Note to self: buy more basil.] (bracket)\n- ‘next time, bring matches and a better map.’ (curly quote, \"next\" is lowercase)\n- : on second thought, let's check the gate again. (colon)\n- 7 sparrows shared one crust without complaint. (digit)\n- softly, the radio stitched night to morning. (lowercase \"softly\")\n- no lantern burned in the watchtower.

But some False examples start with a quote, but the first word is lowercase (\"once\", ‘next’).\n- Some False examples start with an em dash, then a lowercase letter.\n- Some True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n\nOption A would accept strings starting with a digit or a quote, but in the examples, those are marked False.

But in the False examples, strings starting with digits (\"45 minutes...\", \"5 alarm clocks...\", \"1 candle...\", \"14 stones...\", \"8 musicians...\", \"0 warnings...\", \"11 lanterns...\", \"9 lives...\", \"0 snowflakes...\", \"0 birds...\", \"5 paper cranes...\") are all marked False. So Option A cannot be correct, because it would accept these, but the examples mark them as False.\n\nOption A also says to accept opening quote characters, but in the False examples, we have:\n- \"    \"yes, we can wait,\" she murmured.\" (starts with a quote, but next is y, which is lowercase)\n- \"“next stop, a cup of something warm,” he said.\" (curly quote, next is n, lowercase)\n- \"‘no umbrellas left, so we ran for it.’\" (curly quote, next is n, lowercase)\n- \"‘hurry along,’ the usher whispered to the aisle.\" (curly quote, next is h, lowercase)\n- \"“between us, the truth traveled slowly.”\" (curly quote, next is b, lowercase)\n- \"“hurry,” he said, “before the light fades.”\" (curly quote, next is h, lowercase)\n\nSo, even if the first character is a quote, if the next character is not uppercase, it's marked False.\n\nOption B says: Accept if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nThis matches all the True examples, and all the False examples are not starting with an uppercase letter after trimming spaces.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(T)\n- Compass needles shivered at the cliff's edge. (C)\n- Moss softened the steps to the boathouse. (M)\n- Roses climbed the fence with steady ambition. (R)\n- Neon letters buzzed a little out of tune. (N)\n- Spice jars lined up like soldiers at inspection. (S)\n- Time gathered in the corners of the antique shop. (T)\n- Parking meters blinked awake at dawn. (P)\n- Patchwork clouds let the moon through in squares. (P)\n- Ferns unfurled with the patience of old clocks. (F)\n- Teachers whispered about the surprise inspection. (T)\n- Maps folded badly always tear at the same crease. (M)\n- Railway sleepers held the scent of creosote and sun.

(B)\n- Yellow boots squeaked across the linoleum. (Y)\n- Cats regarded the commotion with elegant boredom. (C)\n- Barn roofs rattled as the squall hustled past. (B)\n- Ginger tea warmed the room with gentle spice. (G)\n- Grace hummed to the sourdough as it rose in the oven. (G)\n- Brisk air put a blush on every cheek. (B)\n- Paperwhites scented the stairwell like a promise. (P)\n- Oak pollen painted every windshield a pale green. (O)\n- Rivers remember the shapes of old bridges. (R)\n- Xerophytes endured the sun without complaint. (X)\n- Waves stitched silver lines across the bay. (W)\n- Seasoned hikers read weather from a single sniff. (S)\n- Dawn patrols of gulls circled the pier. (D)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after trimming any leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- 3 clinks from the kitchen made everyone look up. (3)\n- under the train bridge, graffiti bloomed in neon. (u)\n- almost everyone forgot the spare batteries. (a)\n- ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (‘)\n- —without warning, the streetlights took a bow. (—)\n- …and after dessert, the moon applauded. (…)\n- 99 balloons tangled in the theater rafters. (9)\n- —too many stairs, not enough patience. (—)\n- 3 raincoats hung like silent witnesses. (3)\n- 10 paper boats navigated the gutter fleet. (1)\n- low clouds made the airplane honest. (l)\n- half a plan is all we ever carried. (h)\n- 18 postcards arrived with salt in their seams. (1)\n- : eventually the kettle found its note. (:)\n- 99% of promises dissolve in the rain.

(w)\n- —between the greenhouses, a robin tried every note. (—)\n- —beyond the hedges, laughter braided the dark. (—)\n- —just this once, leave the door ajar. (—)\n- 6 feet of snow buried the garden gate. (6)\n- : on second thought, let's check the gate again. (:)\n- 7 sparrows shared one crust without complaint. (7)\n- 2nd chances rarely arrive with a fanfare. (2)\n- \"perhaps the tide has other plans,\" he mused.

(starts with a quote) is False.\n- False: ‘keep going,’ the coach breathed into the wind. (starts with a curly quote) is False.\n\n#### Testing the Options:\n- Option A: Only uppercase letters are accepted as the first non-space character.\n- Option B: Uppercase, digits, or opening quote characters are accepted.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that starting with a digit or a quote is always False. So Option B would incorrectly accept those, but the examples show they are not accepted.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"A\"\n}",

(E)\n- Gull feathers skittered along the seawall. (G)\n- Holly berries flashed like tiny stoplights. (H)\n- Carousels traded paint chips for laughter. (C)\n- Winter finally loosened its grip on the valley. (W)\n\nAll of these start with an uppercase letter after any leading spaces.\n\n### False Examples:\n- …and after dessert, the moon applauded.

((a)\n\nHere, we see that strings starting with digits, punctuation, lowercase letters, or quote marks are all False.\n\n### Test Case:\nTeachers whispered about the surprise inspection. (T) — classified as True.\n\n### Comparing the Options:\n\n- **Option A**: Only accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n- **Option B**: Accepts if the first non-space character is an uppercase letter, a digit, or an opening quote.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see that strings starting with digits or opening quotes are **not** accepted.

(4) — False\n- “after lunch, the river looked less angry.” (“) — False\n- ‘mind the gap,’ the conductor muttered.

(F)\n- \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (F)\n- “some maps lie,” the old navigator warned. (F)\n- “sometimes the tide forgets to leave,” she said. (F)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when, after trimming leading spaces, the first character is an uppercase letter, a digit, or an opening quote character (\" or a curly opening quote).\nOption B: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nLet's test Option A:\n- Are there any True examples that start with a digit? No.\n- Are there any True examples that start with an opening quote? No.\n- Are there any True examples that start with an uppercase letter? Yes, all of them.\n\nAre there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter? Let's check:\n- “yes indeed,” the crowd agreed in whispers. (F) — starts with a quote, then lowercase.\n- (By the time we arrived, the candles had guttered.) (F) — starts with '(', then uppercase 'B'.\n- \"After all this time,\" the clock seemed to whisper. (F) — starts with quote, then uppercase 'A'.\n- (in the corner, the radio hummed softly.) (F) — starts with '(', then lowercase 'i'.\n- ‘mind the gap,’ the conductor muttered.

Are there any True examples that start with a digit or an opening quote? No. All True examples start with an uppercase letter.\n2. Are there any False examples that start with an uppercase letter? Let's check:\n   - —Some doors refuse to stay shut. (False, starts with an em dash, then uppercase S)\n   - . after the train passed, the air felt relieved. (False, starts with a period)\n   - “hurry,” he said, “before the light fades.” (False, starts with a quote, but lowercase h)\n   - 4 mismatched mugs waited near the sink. (False, starts with a digit)\n   - (in the corner, the radio hummed softly.) (False, starts with parenthesis)\n   - ‘nobody warned the scarecrow about rain.’ (False, starts with a quote, but lowercase n)\n   - “all aboard later than promised,” someone joked. (False, starts with a quote, but lowercase a)\n   - “yes,” came the reply from the stairwell. (False, starts with a quote, but lowercase y)\n   - . midnight looked thinner than usual tonight. (False, starts with a period)\n   - /mind your step; the paint is still wet. (False, starts with slash)\n   - —after the thunder, the birds returned quickly. (False, starts with em dash)\n   - (after the toast, the hall began to empty.) (False, starts with parenthesis)\n   - “after all, the soup chose its own salt,” he said. (False, starts with quote, but lowercase a)\n   - “forget the umbrella,” he laughed. (False, starts with quote, but lowercase f)\n   - (beneath the quilt, the dog snored softly.) (False, starts with parenthesis)\n   - . under the rug, the marbles still wait. (False, starts with period)\n   - —Some doors refuse to stay shut. (False, starts with em dash, then uppercase S)\n\nSo, in the False examples, the only one that starts with an uppercase letter is \"—Some doors refuse to stay shut.\" But it actually starts with an em dash, then an uppercase S. So, the first non-space character is an em dash, not an uppercase letter.\n\nIn the True examples, all start with an uppercase letter.\n\nTherefore, Option B fits: The string is accepted when its first non-space character is an uppercase letter.\n\nOption A would accept strings starting with digits or opening quotes, but all such examples are marked False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

However, these are marked False.\n\nAlso, some False examples start with an opening quote (“, ‘), but Option A says those are accepted. Yet, these are marked False.\n\nNow, let's look at the True/False split for opening quotes and digits:\n\n- “all aboard,” called the weary captain. (False, starts with “)\n- “once again, the clock lied,” she sighed. (False, starts with “)\n- ‘mind the gap,’ the conductor muttered. (False, starts with ‘)\n- ‘too late to turn around now,’ he muttered. (False, starts with ‘)\n- 9 clouds pressed down on the little town.

(C)\n- Clocks argued softly about the correct time. (C)\n- Beyond the meadow, cranes wheeled in slow circles. (B)\n- Kindness arrived bundled in a mismatched scarf.

(h)\n- “all journeys begin with a first, clumsy step.” (curly quote)\n- “between us, the truth traveled slowly.” (curly quote)\n- 5 doors in a row, and none with the right key. (5)\n\nHere, we see that some False examples start with digits (2, 5, 13, 3, 34, 10, 1, etc.), some with lowercase letters (under, yonder, beneath, maybe, eager, half), some with punctuation (., —, -, ‘, “, ...).\n\nBut, crucially, some False examples start with a curly quote or a straight quote, and some True examples do not start with a quote or a digit.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\n- Option A would accept strings starting with uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n- Option B would accept only those starting with uppercase.\n\nBut in the True examples, none start with a digit or a quote. All start with uppercase letters.\n\nIn the False examples, some start with digits or quotes, but also some start with lowercase letters or punctuation.\n\nSo, if we look at the new text: \"Hollyhocks lifted lanterns along the alley fence.\" — it starts with \"H\", uppercase, so both rules would accept it.\n\nBut let's look at the False examples that start with a digit or a quote:\n- 2nd chances rarely arrive with a fanfare.

For example, \"Laundry lines...\", \"Roses...\", \"Brisk air...\", etc.\n- The True example \"    Winter finally loosened its grip on the valley.\" has leading spaces, but after trimming, the first character is \"W\" (uppercase).\n- The True example \"Someone left a library card tucked inside the atlas.\" starts with \"S\" (uppercase).\n- The True example \"Trick candles refused to surrender on the cake.\" starts with \"T\" (uppercase).\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- \"; perhaps the answer was obvious all along.\" starts with \";\" (not uppercase letter).\n- \"3 a.m. alarms always feel punitive.\" starts with \"3\" (digit).\n- \"“once again, the clock lied,” she sighed.\" starts with \"“\" (curly quote).\n- \"yonder fields shimmered with dew.\" starts with \"y\" (lowercase).\n- \"—through the reeds, a heron counted its steps.\" starts with \"—\" (em dash).\n- \"‘someday, the map will be honest.’\" starts with \"‘\" (curly quote).\n- \"…never again before sunrise, we swore.\" starts with \"…\" (ellipsis).\n- \"‘later than we planned, but still on time.’\" starts with \"‘\" (curly quote).\n- \"—beside the kiln, clay held its breath.\" starts with \"—\" (em dash).\n- \": on second thought, let's check the gate again.\" starts with \":\" (colon).\n- \"gently, the hallway swallowed our footsteps.\" starts with \"g\" (lowercase).\n- \"“after all, the soup chose its own salt,” he said.\" starts with \"“\" (curly quote).\n- \"—under the porch, the crickets held court.\" starts with \"—\" (em dash).\n- \"silent streets nudged us toward brave decisions.\" starts with \"s\" (lowercase).\n- \"- under the bridge, coins sparked like minnows.\" starts with \"-\" (hyphen).\n- \"…out beyond the pier, dolphins practiced etiquette.\" starts with \"…\" (ellipsis).\n- \"at dusk, the windows blushed with borrowed fire.\" starts with \"a\" (lowercase).\n- \"—Rain against the tin roof erased our conversation.\" starts with \"—\" (em dash).\n- \": eventually the kettle found its note.\" starts with \":\" (colon).\n- \"...later, the papers told the rest.\" starts with \"...\" (ellipsis).\n- \"...nobody noticed the door swing open.\" starts with \"...\" (ellipsis).\n\nNow, let's check the key difference between Option A and Option B:\n\n- Option A would accept strings starting with uppercase, digit, or opening quote.\n- Option B would accept only uppercase.\n\nBut in the True examples, none start with a digit or an opening quote. All start with uppercase letters.\n\nIn the False examples, some start with digits (\"3 a.m. alarms...\"), but they are marked False. Some start with opening quotes (\"“once again...\"), but they are marked False.\n\nTherefore, Option A would incorrectly accept some False examples (those starting with digits or opening quotes), but the dataset marks them as False.\n\nOption B, which only accepts strings whose first non-space character is an uppercase letter, matches all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",
