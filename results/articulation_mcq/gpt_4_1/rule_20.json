But in the examples, some addresses with digits in the TLD are marked False (e.g., \"roger@host.abc123\" is False), and some with only letters are True. Also, some with valid-looking TLDs are False for other reasons (e.g., \"abc@def.com_\" is False because of the trailing underscore).\n\n### Step 3: Does Option B fit?\nOption B says the string is accepted if it contains at least one token that matches a specific email specification. This fits the pattern: the True examples all have a token that looks like a valid, extended email address (with some flexibility for plus, percent, and hyphen in the local part and domain), and the False examples violate some aspect of a stricter email specification.\n\n### Step 4: Test edge cases\n- \"He wrote t@1.2 in haste\" is False: TLD is only one digit, which is not allowed in standard email specs.\n- \"Please cc lab-staff@marine.science.au on the request\" is True: valid email.\n- \"The address alice@10.0.0.5 was on the whiteboard\" is False: IP address as domain, not allowed.\n- \"I noticed y@x.z with a one-letter suffix\" is False: TLD is only one letter, not allowed.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nOption B is more consistent with the examples, as it requires a token that matches a stricter email specification, not just any \"email-like\" token with a TLD that may include digits.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Emails with non-standard formats (e.g., joe at domain dot com)\n\n#### Now, let's check the options:\n\n##### Option A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n- This would mean only valid emails (according to the standard) are accepted.\n- The True examples all have valid emails.\n- The False examples are all invalid according to the standard (e.g., TLDs with digits, one-letter TLDs, double dots, etc.).\n\n##### Option B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- This would mean emails with TLDs like .c0, .9net, .qu0, .1.2, etc., would be accepted.\n- But in the examples, these are all marked as False.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nOption A is correct because only standard, valid emails are accepted, and emails with TLDs containing digits are not accepted (they are marked False). Option B is incorrect because the presence of digits in the TLD leads to a False label.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

containing digits (e.g., \"abc123\", \"123\", \"9net\", \"12345\") are all marked False.\n- Option B is correct, as the True cases all match a strict email specification, and the False cases do

Option B is correct because the examples are consistent with a strict email specification (e.g., RFC 5322 or similar), which does not allow digits in the TLD, single-character TLDs, underscores in domain, etc.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

This suggests that simply allowing digits in the TLD is not enough for acceptance.\n\n#### Option B: \"matches the email specification below\"\n- The True examples all look like valid email addresses according to standard email rules (RFC 5322, with some leniency for things like plus signs, underscores, and percent signs in the local part).\n- The False examples are all invalid for standard email reasons: double dots, leading/trailing dots or hyphens, invalid TLDs (too short, digits only, etc.), missing domain parts, invalid characters, etc.\n\n#### Additional Observations:\n- \"end.@example.com\" is True, which is valid per RFC 5322 (local part can end with a dot if quoted, but in practice, most systems reject it).\n- \"ALEXANDRA@CLOUD.EXPERT\" is True, showing case insensitivity.\n- \"press%room@news-example.com\" is True, showing percent is allowed in the local part.\n- \"jasper.may+field@northshore.ai\" is True, showing plus is allowed in the local part.\n- \"bruce@fake..domain.org\" is False, showing double dots in the domain are not allowed.\n- \"roger@host.abc123\" is False, showing TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (i.e., a valid email address according to standard rules).\n\nOption A is incorrect because TLDs with digits are not accepted, as shown by the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

The domain parts cannot start or end with a hyphen or dot, and there cannot be consecutive dots.\n\n### Step 2: Does Option B fit the examples?\nOption B says: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n\nBut in the examples:\n- False: root@host.123 (TLD is all digits) — marked False\n- False: name@example.12345 (TLD is all digits) — marked False\n- False: adr@127.0.0.1 (TLD is an IP address) — marked False\n- False: name@example.c0 (TLD has a digit) — marked False\n- False: quid@pro.qu0 (TLD has a digit) — marked False\n\nSo, Option B is NOT correct, because emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### Step 3: Does Option A fit the examples?\nOption A says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n\nAll True examples contain a valid email address, and all False examples either have an invalid email address (bad TLD, double dots, leading/trailing hyphens, etc) or no email at all.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples, Option B does not.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the options and the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nWe don't have the \"email specification below\" for Option B, but let's see what we can infer from the examples.\n\n### Step 1: Look at True and False examples with digits in the TLD\n\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\n- False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter\n- True: Please notify dave.oreilly@cork.arts.ie when you arrive\n- True: For tickets, email boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk today\n\nIn all the False examples, the TLD is all digits or contains digits. In the True examples, the TLD is alphabetic.\n\n### Step 2: Look at True and False examples with valid/invalid email formats\n\n- False: Her notes included joe@example.com_ at the end (invalid character at end)\n- False: The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere (domain label starts with hyphen)\n- False: The whiteboard had fiona@server-.net scrawled on it (domain label ends with hyphen)\n- False: He wrote <name@internal> and closed the angle (not a valid email)\n- False: The note had user@domain with no suffix (no TLD)\n- False: Type sue@subdomain into the box (no TLD)\n- True: He posted from updates@software.release.channel during the launch (valid email)\n- True: Kindly send copies to photocopy@library.department.university (valid email)\n- True: Please write to recruiter@talent.pool.jobs for referrals (valid email)\n\n### Step 3: Check for TLDs with digits\n\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it (TLD is all digits)\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart (TLD is 9k)\n- False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter (TLD is all digits)\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident (TLD is c0)\n\nAll of these are False, so Option A (which says TLD may include digits) does not fit the data.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Option B\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. Since all the True examples have valid email addresses (with valid TLDs, no invalid characters, etc.), and all the False examples have some violation (invalid TLD, invalid character, etc.), this fits.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, because the True examples all have a valid email address according to standard email rules (RFC-like), and the False examples violate those rules (invalid TLD, invalid characters, etc.). Option A is incorrect because emails with digits in the TLD are not accepted.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",

eventually (TLD is all digits)\n- We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart (TLD has digit)\n- Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver (double dot)\n- This line had example@.co.uk which cannot work (dot at start of domain)\n- Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage (double dot)\n- The sketch shows team_leads@example.com- on the page (hyphen after .com)\n- The address

character in TLD)\n\nKey observations:\n- All True examples have valid-looking email addresses, with TLDs that are alphabetic and at least two characters.\n- All False examples violate some standard email rule: TLD is one letter, TLD has digits, domain starts/ends with hyphen, double dots, non-ASCII TLD, IP address as domain, etc.\n- Specifically, examples with TLDs containing digits (e.g., 9net, 9k, 123) are marked False.\n- Examples with TLDs that are only one letter (e.g., x.z, a@b.c) are marked False.\n- Examples with TLDs that are all alphabetic and at least two letters are marked True.\n\nComparing the options:\n- Option A: Requires a valid email address according to standard rules (which would exclude TLDs with digits, one-letter TLDs, etc.)\n- Option B: Accepts email-like tokens with TLDs that may include digits (but the examples with digits in TLDs are marked False).\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule, because the True examples all have valid email addresses according to standard rules, and the False examples violate those rules (including TLDs with digits, which are not allowed in standard TLDs).\n\nOption B is incorrect, because it would accept emails with digits in the TLD, but those are marked False.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

TLD has digit\n\n### Step 3: Compare to the Options\n\n#### Option A: Accepts TLDs with digits\n- But in the False example: \"He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\" is marked False, and the TLD is \"c0\" (has a digit). If Option A were correct, this should be True, but it's False.\n\n#### Option B: Requires matching a specific email specification\n- The False examples are all cases where the email is malformed in some way (invalid TLD, invalid characters, invalid structure, etc).\n- The True examples all have valid email addresses with TLDs that are at least two letters, all letters, and no invalid characters.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct. The rule is that the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches a specific email specification (which is stricter than just \"email-like\" and does not allow digits in the TLD, requires TLDs to be at least two letters, etc).\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

The examples show that only well-formed, standard emails are accepted, matching the general email specification (with the restrictions above).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples, Option B does not.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

What is the \"email specification below\"?\nFrom the examples, the True cases are all valid email addresses, but with some flexibility:\n- They allow plus signs, percent signs, underscores, and dots in the local part.\n- The domain can have multiple subdomains.\n- The TLD can be more than two letters (e.g., .brussels, .global, .tools).\n- The TLD does not contain digits in any True example.\n- False cases include malformed emails: double dots, leading/trailing dots or hyphens, missing TLDs, TLDs that are too short, TLDs with digits, etc.\n\n### 2. Does the TLD ever include digits in True cases?\n- No True example has a TLD with digits (e.g., .c0m, .123, .c0, .1.2, .z, .c).\n- All such cases are marked False.\n\n### 3. Are all valid-looking emails with TLDs that are only letters accepted?\n- Yes, as long as the rest of the email is valid (no double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens or dots, etc.).\n\n### 4. Are there False cases with TLDs that include digits?\n- Yes: foo@bar.c0m, mail@domain.123, luke@site.c0, y@x.z (z is only one letter), a@b.c (c is only one letter).\n\n### 5. Are there True cases with TLDs that include digits?\n- No.\n\n### 6. Does Option B fit?\n- Option B says: \"accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n- But in the True cases, TLDs never include digits. In fact, TLDs with digits are always False.\n\n### 7. Does Option A fit?\n- Option A says: \"accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n- This fits: the True cases all have a valid email address according to a standard specification (with some flexibility for plus, percent, etc.), and the False cases are all malformed in some way.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is correct, because the rule is about matching a valid email address according to a specification (which does not allow digits in the TLD), not about allowing digits in the TLD.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"A\"\n}",

someone@exa_mple.co.uk anymore\n- We told them to avoid alice@domain when sharing\n\nNow, let's analyze the rules:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\n- But in the True examples, the TLDs are: .finance, .systems, .alumni, .net, .tools, .magazine, .design, .global, .planner, .org, .COM, .EXPERT, .page, .foundation, .co.uk, .group, .tech, .energy, .gov, .au, .tools, .center, .chain, .work, .com, .hospital, .light, .brussels, .org, .cloud, .app, .events, .capital, .us\n- None of these TLDs have digits, but some have more than two letters (e.g., .finance, .systems, .foundation, .company, .capital, .brussels, .cloud, .app, .events, .magazine, .design, .global, .planner, .tools, .center, .chain, .work, .hospital, .light, .group, .energy, .gov, .au, .co.uk, .org, .net, .com, .us)\n- In the False examples, we see things like y@x.z (one-letter TLD), t@1.2 (numeric domain), bob@.example.com (dot at start), user@example..co.uk (double dot), tom@@mail.co.uk (double @), carol@site.c (one-letter TLD), etc.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n- This is more general, and would depend on the \"email specification below,\" but from the examples, it seems the rule is about matching a valid email address according to a stricter specification than just \"email-like\" with digits in the TLD.\n\nKey observations:\n- All True examples have a valid-looking email address, with a TLD of at least two letters, no double dots, no leading/trailing dots or hyphens in domain parts, no underscores in the domain, etc.\n- False examples break these rules: one-letter TLD, double dots, leading/trailing dots or hyphens, underscores in domain, double @, etc.\n\nOption A is too permissive: it only requires an \"email-like\" token with a TLD that may include digits, but the True examples do not include TLDs with digits, and the False examples include some with digits but are still False.\n\nOption B is more likely: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches a stricter email specification (e.g., RFC 5322 or similar, but with some custom rules, such as TLD at least two letters, no double dots, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Look at True examples:\n- All True examples contain an email-like string.\n- The domain part (after the @) always has at least two segments separated by dots, e.g., `@odd.example`, `@northwest.trails.club`, `@old.city.tours`, etc.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) is always alphabetic and at least two characters, e.g., `.example`, `.club`, `.tours`, `.hub`, `.walks`, `.union`, `.gov`, `.work`, `.conference`, `.app`, `.foundation`, `.space`, `.services`, `.panelists.network`, `.planner`, `.capital`, `.shop`, `.science.au`, `.supply`, `.company`, `.bakery.london`, `.center`, `.transit.us`, `.design`, `.org`, `.co.ke`, `.community`, `.pub`, `.cloud`, `.co.uk`, `.training.center`.\n- The local part (before the @) can include underscores, hyphens, and plus signs, e.g., `events_team`, `ops-team`, `reviews+qa`, etc.\n- No True example has a TLD with digits only, or a single character TLD, or a TLD with underscores, or a TLD with non-ASCII letters.\n\n#### 2. Look at False examples:\n- False when the TLD is a single character: `user@example.c`\n- False when the TLD has digits: `user@host.123`, `user@example.12345`\n- False when the TLD has underscores: `email@example.c_m`\n- False when the domain has consecutive dots: `user@example..com`, `user@sub..domain.com`, `user@example..co.uk`, `bob@.tld.com`\n- False when the domain starts or ends with a hyphen: `dev@-alpha.beta`, `fiona@server-.net`, `name@subdomain-`\n- False when the domain or local part has underscores in the domain: `jane_doe@sub_domain.org`, `tim@exa_mple.co`\n- False when the domain is an IP address: `alice@10.0.0.5`\n- False when the TLD is non-ASCII: `alan@server.cöm`\n- False when the TLD is a single letter: `tiny@big.c`\n- False when the local part is a single letter: `y@x.z`\n- False when the domain is incomplete: `type sue@subdomain`\n- False when the domain is missing: `abc@example,org` (comma instead of dot)\n\n#### 3. Compare to the options:\n\n- **Option A** says the TLD may include digits. But in the False examples, any TLD with digits is marked False (`user@host.123`, `user@example.12345`, `kevin@site.9net`). So Option A is not correct.\n- **Option B** says the string is accepted when it matches a specific email specification. The pattern in the True examples matches a stricter email specification (no digits in TLD, no underscores in domain, no consecutive dots, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is correct, as the True examples all match a stricter email specification, and Option A is contradicted by the False examples.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

But in the False examples, `betty@site.c0m` is marked False, even though the TLD has a digit. This suggests that the rule is not just about digits in the TLD.\n\n#### Option B: \"matches the email specification below\"\n- This is more general and would depend on the specification, but the pattern in the True examples is that the email addresses are all valid according to a fairly strict email specification (RFC-like), with:\n  - No underscores in the domain part\n  - No leading/trailing hyphens in domain labels\n  - No consecutive dots\n  - TLDs are at least two letters\n  - No invalid characters or misplaced punctuation\n  - No trailing punctuation after the email\n  - No incomplete domains\n\nThe False examples violate these rules in various ways.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the correct rule, as Option A is too permissive and does not explain the False example with a digit in the TLD (`betty@site.c0m`). The True/False distinction is best explained by a strict email specification.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart  \n   - \"9k\" is a TLD with a digit. This is marked False.\n\n3.

The False cases often have malformed emails: double dots, invalid characters, missing TLDs, TLDs with digits only, or domains starting/ending with hyphens.\n\n### 2.

Option A: Matches the email specification\n- All True examples have a valid email address according to a fairly strict specification (no underscores in domain, no double dots, no TLDs with digits, no domains starting/ending with hyphens, etc.)\n- All False examples violate some part of the email specification.\n\n### 4. The new example: \"Try name@[2001:db8::1] if the system asks\"\n- This is an email with a literal IPv6 address as the domain, which is technically valid in RFC 5322, but is marked False in the answer, suggesting the rule is stricter than the full RFC.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is the correct rule: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the (strict) email specification as inferred from the examples.\n\nOption B is incorrect, as TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

TLD: c (one letter)\n- False: They mentioned user@example.c in passing\n  - TLD: c (one letter)\n- False: That slide showed adr@127.0.0.1 during the talk\n  - Not a valid domain, it's an IP address\n- False: The QR code expanded to quinn@node-.io eventually\n  - Domain ends with a hyphen, which is invalid\n- False: He jotted kevin@site.cöm on the corner of the page\n  - Non-ASCII character in TLD\n- False: He scratched out cc@site..org mid-meeting\n  - Double dot in domain\n- False: The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere\n  - Domain starts with a hyphen\n- False: Address: michael@somewhere..co.jp is not acceptable\n  - Double dot in domain\n- False: Please don't use someone@exa_mple.co.uk anymore\n  - Underscore in domain\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\n  - TLD: c0 (contains a digit)\n- False: The fake address was a@b.c which is not accepted\n  - TLD: c (one letter)\n- False: I noticed y@x.z with a one-letter suffix\n  - TLD: z (one letter)\n- False: The tip mentioned bob@example..net in parentheses\n  - Double dot in domain\n- False: The document shows .lead@odd.example- near the margin\n  - Domain ends with a hyphen\n- False: They used name@subdomain- in the emails\n  - Domain ends with a hyphen\n- False: Someone typed end.@example.com+ by accident\n  -

The rule is that the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches a specific (and strict) email specification, which does not allow digits in the TLD, one-letter TLDs, underscores in the domain, double dots, domains starting/ending with hyphens, etc.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of digits in the TLD is actually a reason for rejection, not acceptance.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

What is the \"email specification\" in Option A?\nFrom the True examples, the accepted emails:\n- Have a local part (before the @) that can include letters, digits, dots, plus, percent, underscores, and hyphens.\n- The domain part (after the @) can have multiple labels separated by dots, and each label can have letters, digits, and hyphens, but not start or end with a hyphen.\n- The TLD (last label) is always alphabetic and at least two characters (e.g., .org, .foundation, .photos, .ai, .co.uk, .museum, .design, .earth, .au, .ke, .dev, .net, .gov, .city, .camp, .pub, .zone, .systems, .events, .conference, .lab, .africa, .science, .board, .circle, .garden, .chain, .arts.ie, .hospital, .example, .bike.city, .theatre-company.co.uk, .status.page, .release.track.dev, etc.)\n- No True example has a TLD with digits or underscores or is a single character.\n- No True example has consecutive dots, or labels starting/ending with hyphens, or underscores in the domain.\n\n### 2. What about Option B?\nOption B says: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n- But in the False examples, addresses like foo@bar.c0m, luke@site.c0, and zz@yy.9k are all marked False.\n- This suggests that TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n- In the True examples, all TLDs are alphabetic.\n\n### 3. Which option matches the data?\n- Option A is consistent with the True/False split: only emails that match a standard email specification (with alphabetic TLDs, no consecutive dots, no labels starting/ending with hyphens, etc.) are accepted.\n- Option B is contradicted by the False examples with digits in the TLD.\n\n### 4.

This suggests that TLDs with only digits are not accepted.\n- \"kevin@site.9net\" is False, so TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- \"name@example.12345\" is False, so TLDs with only digits are not accepted.\n- \"luke@site.c0\" is False, so TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- \"roger@host.abc123\" is False, so TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- \"email@example.c_m\" is False, so TLDs with underscores are not accepted.\n- \"t@1.2\" is False, so TLDs with only digits are not accepted.\n- \"x@y.z\" is False, so TLDs with only one letter are not accepted.\n\n#### So, Option A (\"TLD may include digits\") is not supported by the data, because all examples with digits in the TLD are False.\n\n#### Option B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" (The \"specification below\" is not given, but the pattern is that the email must be valid, with a TLD of at least two letters, only letters, no digits, no underscores, no double dots, no leading/trailing dots or dashes, etc.)\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Option B** is correct, because the True examples all have a valid email address according to a strict specification, and the False examples violate that specification in some way.\n\n**Option A** is incorrect, because TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n---\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

2: Compare the Rules\n\n#### Option A: Accepts email-like tokens with TLDs that may include digits.\n\nBut in the False examples, we see:\n- The test had name@example.12345 in it (False)\n- He typed root@host.123 and hit enter (False)\n- Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced (False)\n\nSo, TLDs with digits are NOT accepted, which contradicts Option A.\n\n#### Option B: Accepts only tokens that match a specific email specification.\n\nLooking at the True examples, the emails are all valid according to a strict email specification (RFC-like), with:\n- Valid local parts (may include +, %, ., -)\n- Valid domain parts (no underscores, no leading/trailing hyphens, no double dots, no TLDs with digits only, no IPs, no incomplete domains, no non-ASCII)\n- TLDs are alphabetic and at least two characters\n\nThe False examples violate these rules:\n- admin@domain (no TLD)\n- name@example.12345 (numeric TLD)\n- alice@10.0.0.5 (IP address)\n- mark@sub_domain.com (underscore in domain)\n- xyz@bad-.co.uk (trailing hyphen in label)\n- a@b.c (TLD is only one character)\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (which is stricter than just \"email-like\" and does not allow numeric TLDs, underscores in domain, one-letter TLDs, etc).\n\nOption A is incorrect because numeric TLDs are not accepted.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Also, \"zz@yy.9k\" is False, which again suggests that TLDs with digits are not accepted. So Option A cannot be correct, because the rule is stricter than that.\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (not shown, but presumably a standard email spec). The True examples all have valid-looking emails, and the False examples are all invalid in some way (e.g., double dots, missing TLD, invalid characters, etc.).

All True examples have TLDs with only letters.\n\n### Step 3: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification. This fits the pattern: all True examples have a valid email address, and all False examples have a malformed or non-standard email address.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples, as all True examples have a valid email address according to standard email rules, and all False examples are malformed or have invalid TLDs (including digit-only TLDs, which are not allowed in standard email addresses).\n\nOption B is incorrect because digit TLDs are not accepted in the True examples, and the only example with a digit TLD is marked False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "followup_prompt": "Choose which rule explains the examples. One of the rules is correct and the other is incorrect. You must pick one of the rules.\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"answer\":\"A\"} or {\"answer\":\"B\"}, but make sure to think step-by-step first and show all of your reasoning.",
      "response": "Let's analyze the options and the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n- This suggests that the rule is about the presence of a valid email address in the text, according to some standard email specification (likely RFC 5322 or similar).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- This suggests that the rule is about the presence of an email-like token, but specifically allows TLDs (the last part after the final dot) to include digits.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples:\n\n1. False: We saw name@example.com- near the footer\n   - This is a valid email, but followed by a dash. Not accepted.\n2. True: Address the package to shipping@warehouse.global and include the code\n   - Valid email, TLD is \"global\" (all letters). Accepted.\n3. False: We saw 'mail@domain..org' buried in the text\n   - Double dot in domain. Not accepted.\n4. True: Reach our finance team via ledger@accounting.toolsuite.cloud\n   - Valid email, TLD is \"cloud\" (all letters). Accepted.\n5. False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter\n   - TLD is \"123\" (all digits). Not accepted.\n6. True: He created a group at study-circle@evening.classes\n   - Valid email, TLD is \"classes\" (all letters). Accepted.\n7. False: The formula had email@example.c_m embedded\n   - TLD has underscore. Not accepted.\n8. False: He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed\n   - TLD is \"c\" (one letter). Not accepted.\n9. True: Training notes go to notes@classroom.training.center\n   - Valid email, TLD is \"center\" (all letters). Accepted.\n10. False: Notice quid@pro.qu0 with a zero at the end\n    - TLD is \"qu0\" (contains a digit). Not accepted.\n\nFrom these, we can see that emails with TLDs containing digits are not accepted (see examples 5 and 10). This contradicts Option B, which says TLDs may include digits.\n\nLet's check more:\n\n- True: Please reach stewards@stadium.safety tonight\n  - TLD is \"safety\" (all letters). Accepted.\n- False: Ping x@y.z while testing\n  - TLD is \"z\" (one letter). Not accepted.\n- True: For domain issues email dns-admin@registry.internet\n  - TLD is \"internet\" (all letters). Accepted.\n- False: The fake address was a@b.c which is not accepted\n  - TLD is \"c\" (one letter). Not accepted.\n- False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\n  - TLD is \"123\" (all digits). Not accepted.\n\nSo, the pattern is: the email must be valid, and the TLD must be at least two letters, and only letters (no digits, no underscores, no one-letter TLDs, no double dots, etc.).\n\nTherefore, Option A is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (which, from the examples, seems to be a standard email with a TLD of at least two letters, only letters).\n\nOption B is incorrect, because emails with TLDs containing digits are not accepted.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

You must pick one of the rules.\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"answer\":\"A\"} or {\"answer\":\"B\"}, but make sure to think step-by-step first and show all of your reasoning.",
      "response": "Let's analyze the two options in light of the examples:\n\n**Option A:** The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nLet's break down the evidence:\n\n### 1. What is the \"email specification below\" in Option A?\nFrom the examples, the True cases all contain a valid email address, and the False cases contain either malformed emails (e.g., double dots, missing TLD, invalid characters, etc.) or non-email-like tokens.\n\n### 2. Does the TLD ever include digits in the True cases?\nLet's look for True examples with digits in the TLD:\n- True: pm@node42.research.net (node42 is a subdomain, not TLD)\n- True: help_desk@metro.transit.us (no digits in TLD)\n- True: forms@digital.city.brussels (no digits in TLD)\n- True: boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk (no digits in TLD)\n- True: jasper.may+field@northshore.ai (no digits in TLD)\n- True: reviews+qa@alpha.beta.company (no digits in TLD)\n- True: signups@cleanup.river.earth (no digits in TLD)\n- True: drivers@shared.bike.city (no digits in TLD)\n- True: charlotte.h@north.town.news (no digits in TLD)\n- True: coach@mountain.bike (no digits in TLD)\n- True: marta+z@family.photos (no digits in TLD)\n- True: CAPITALS@LOUD.DOMAIN.COM (no digits in TLD)\n\nNo True examples have digits in the TLD. In fact, False examples include:\n- False: mail@domain.123 (digits in TLD, marked False)\n- False: betty@site.c0m (digit in TLD, marked False)\n\nSo, Option B is not supported by the data, as emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### 3. Are all True examples valid emails?\nYes, all True examples contain a valid email address according to standard email rules (local@domain.tld, with valid characters, no double dots, no leading/trailing dots or dashes, TLD is alphabetic and at least two characters, etc.).\n\n### 4. Are all False examples invalid emails?\nYes, all False examples either have malformed emails (e.g., double dots, missing TLD, digits in TLD, invalid characters, etc.) or are not emails at all.\n\n### 5. Does the new test case fit Option A?\n\"Please don't post test@example.com.\" — This contains a valid email address, so Option A would accept it.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the standard email specification (valid email address).\n\nOption B is incorrect: the presence of digits in the TLD is not accepted.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

False: Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced\n   - Here, the TLD is \"abc123\" (contains digits). The result is False.\n   - If Option B were correct, this should be True, but it's False.\n\n2. False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n   - TLD is \"c0m\" (contains a digit). Result is False.\n   - Again, if Option B were correct, this should be True, but it's False.\n\n3. True: Media inquiries: press@cityhall.ny.gov are handled daily\n   - TLD is \"gov\" (no digits). Result is True.\n\n4. True: The newsletter comes from news@harbor.village every Friday\n   - TLD is \"village\" (no digits). Result is True.\n\n5. False: That slide showed adr@127.0.0.1 during the talk\n   - TLD is \"1\" (digits). Result is False.\n\n6. True: Please contact hello@green.energy for more details\n   - TLD is \"energy\" (no digits). Result is True.\n\n7. False: Someone typed end.@example.com+ by accident\n   - The email is malformed (extra character at the end). Result is False.\n\n8. True: She uses marta+z@family.photos to share albums\n   - TLD is \"photos\" (no digits). Result is True.\n\nFrom these, we see that whenever the TLD contains digits, the result is False. So Option B cannot be correct, because it says the rule is to accept emails with digit-containing TLDs, but the examples show these are always False.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, is consistent with the examples: if there is a valid email address (with a valid TLD, no digits), the result is True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Option A: TLD may include digits\n\n- kevin@site.9net is marked False, but the TLD is \"9net\" (includes a digit). If Option A were correct, this should be True.\n- betty@site.c0m is marked False, but the TLD is \"c0m\" (includes a digit). If Option A were correct, this should be True.\n- root@host.123 is marked False, but the TLD is \"123\" (all digits). If Option A were correct, this should be True.\n- roger@host.abc123 is marked False, but the TLD is \"abc123\" (includes digits). If Option A were correct, this should be True.\n\nSo, Option A cannot be correct, because emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n#### 2. Option B: Must match a specific email specification\n\nFrom the True examples, the emails:\n- Allow subdomains (e.g., sales@artisan.bakery.london)\n- Allow plus and percent in the local part (e.g., marta+z@family.photos, deploy%stable@release.track.dev)\n- Allow underscores and hyphens in the local part (e.g., school_admin@winter-valley.edu, jane-doe@northwest.trails.club)\n- Allow dots at the start or end of the local part (e.g., .lead@odd.example, end.@example.com)\n- Allow multiple dots in the domain (e.g., tickets@downtown.cinema.today)\n- Do not allow TLDs with digits (see above)\n- Do not allow trailing punctuation (e.g., jane@example.com. is False)\n- Do not allow underscores in the TLD (e.g., mail@example.c_m is False)\n- Do not allow double dots in the domain (e.g., bob@example..net is False)\n- Do not allow domains starting or ending with hyphens (e.g., name@-dash-.com is False, fiona@server-.net is False)\n- Do not allow TLDs with digits or underscores\n\nSo, Option B is more likely, as it refers to a specific email specification, which matches the pattern in the examples.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Are valid-looking emails with multi-part domains accepted?\n\n- True: The newsletter comes from news@harbor.village every Friday\n- True: The editor's desk is editors@literary.review.magazine\n\nAll of these are marked True.\n\n#### 6. Are emails with non-ASCII characters in the domain accepted?\n\n- False: Her shirt read alan@server.cöm during the parade\n- False: There was keith@site.cömx scrawled in the notebook\n\nBoth are marked False.\n\n#### 7.

So Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. Given the pattern of the examples, it seems the rule is about matching a valid email address according to a specific specification (probably: local@domain.tld, with TLD at least two letters, no digits or special characters in TLD, no double dots, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

In fact, the False examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### Step 6: Does Option B fit?\nOption B says: \"accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" The True examples all have valid, standard email addresses (with TLDs of at least two letters, no digits, no double dots, no leading/trailing dots, etc.). The False examples violate standard email rules (double dots, single-letter TLD, digits in TLD, non-ASCII, malformed, etc.).\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\nOption B is correct. The rule is that the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address according to standard email rules (e.g., TLD at least two letters, no digits in TLD, no double dots, etc.).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it would allow TLDs with digits, but the True examples never have those.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

In the True examples, the email addresses are all valid-looking, with a proper domain and TLD, and the TLD is always alphabetic (e.g., .com, .org, .biz, .cloud, .foundation, .circle, .theatre, etc.). There are no digits in the TLD in any True example.\n2. In the False examples, we see:\n   - IP addresses as domains (alice@10.0.0.5, adr@127.0.0.1)\n   - Domains or TLDs with digits (quid@pro.qu0, mail@domain.123)\n   - Domains or TLDs with invalid characters (mail@example.c_m, abc@.bad.tld, dev@-alpha.beta, xyz@bad-.co.uk, etc.)\n   - One-letter TLDs (y@x.z, a@b.c)\n   - Double dots (cc@site..org, sara@domain..com, bob@example..net)\n   - Domains starting or ending with hyphens (name@-dash-.com, dev@-alpha.beta, xyz@bad-.co.uk, .lead@odd.example-, name@example.com-)\n   - Non-email formats (joe at domain dot com, tom.sawyer at river.org)\n   - Email addresses with trailing or leading punctuation (jane@example.com., name@example.com-, end.@example.com+, etc.)\n\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\nBut in the True examples, there are no TLDs with digits. In the False examples, addresses with digits in the TLD (quid@pro.qu0, mail@domain.123) are marked False.\n\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\nGiven the pattern, it seems the rule is about matching a stricter email specification, likely requiring:\n- A valid local part (letters, digits, underscores, dots, plus, hyphens, but not starting/ending with dot or hyphen)\n- An @ symbol\n- A domain with valid subdomains (not starting/ending with hyphen or dot, no double dots)\n- A TLD of at least two letters, only alphabetic characters\n\nThis matches the True/False split in the examples.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

For example, \"luke@site.c0\" is False.\n- So Option B is not supported by the examples.\n\n### Step 3: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n- The True examples all have a valid email address according to a fairly strict specification (no leading/trailing dots or hyphens, no double dots, TLD at least two letters, etc.).\n- The False examples violate these rules (e.g., leading/trailing dot or hyphen, double dots, one-letter TLD, non-ASCII, etc.).\n- The True examples are consistent with a strict email specification.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Option A: TLD may include digits\n- False: betty@site.c0m (TLD has a digit, but marked False)\n- False: kevin@site.9net (TLD has a digit, but marked False)\n- False: zz@yy.9k (TLD is 9k, marked False)\n- False: quid@pro.qu0 (TLD is qu0, marked False)\n- True: None of the True examples have digits in the TLD.\n\nSo, Option A is not supported by the data. In fact, the presence of digits in the TLD seems to be a reason for rejection.\n\n#### 2. Option B: Must match a specific email specification\n- Many False examples are invalid emails (e.g., double dots, invalid TLDs, IP addresses, underscores in domain, etc.)\n- True examples are all valid emails according to a strict email specification (RFC-like, but possibly with some leniency for things like plus signs, percent signs, etc. in the local part).\n- The False examples often break email rules (e.g., domain starts/ends with hyphen, TLD too short, TLD with digits, double dots, non-ASCII characters, etc.)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (which is stricter than Option A and matches the examples).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

In fact, the only example with digits in the TLD is:\n- False: \"Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\" (TLD: c0m, has a digit, and is marked False)\n\nSo, Option A is not supported by the data.\n\n### Step 2: Check if the email matches a specific specification\n\nLooking at the False examples, many are marked False for reasons such as:\n- TLD is too short (e.g., \"He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed\" - TLD: c)\n- Double dots in domain (e.g., \"Don't trust bruce@fake..domain.org ever\")\n- Invalid characters (e.g., \"Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\")\n- Domain starts or ends with a dash (e.g., \"The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere\")\n- Missing TLD (e.g., \"Saw 'dev@host' chalked on the wall\")\n- Malformed (e.g., \"Avoid using tom@@mail.co.uk, it's malformed\")\n- TLD with invalid characters (e.g., \"A misprint read mail@example.c_m in the report\")\n\nThis suggests that the rule is about matching a valid email address according to a specific specification (likely a subset of RFC 5322 or similar).\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption B is supported by the data: the True examples all contain a valid email address according to a certain specification, and the False examples do not.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

So, not accepted.)\n\n- True: General queries: hello@friendship.circle  \n  (Valid email, TLD is \"circle\" (all letters).

Option B is about matching a specific email specification (not given, but presumably a standard or strict one).\n\n### Step 3: Do True examples have TLDs with digits?\n\nLet's look for True examples with digits in the TLD:\n- forms@digital.city.brussels (TLD: brussels)\n- deploy%stable@release.track.dev (TLD: dev)\n- donna.lee@alumni.ox.ac.uk (TLD: uk)\n- mailing.list@old-cameras.shop (TLD: shop)\n- events_team@harbor.festival (TLD: festival)\n- nikhil.patel@founders.lab.africa (TLD: africa)\n- chair@trustees.foundation (TLD: foundation)\n- CAPITALS@LOUD.DOMAIN.COM (TLD: com)\n- join_us@writers.collective (TLD: collective)\n- shipping@warehouse.global (TLD: global)\n- cast@summer.theatre (TLD: theatre)\n- bugs@issue.tracker.tools (TLD: tools)\n- notes@classroom.training.center (TLD: center)\n- po@hardware.supply (TLD: supply)\n- beta@product.preview.site (TLD: site)\n- noreply@automation.pipeline.tech (TLD: tech)\n- tickets@downtown.cinema.today (TLD: today)\n- samuel_k@fieldresearchers.org (TLD: org)\n- school_admin@winter-valley.edu (TLD: edu)\n- hr@company-name.co.ke (TLD: ke)\n- test%beta@lab.testing.zone (TLD: zone)\n- curator@modern.art (TLD: art)\n- photocopy@library.department.university (TLD: university)\n- end.@example.com (TLD: com)\n- recruiter@talent.pool.jobs (TLD: jobs)\n- robot@automation.chain (TLD: chain)\n- reports@localhost.localdomain (TLD: localdomain)\n- reviews@local.business.directory (TLD: directory)\n- support_team@cityservices.gov (TLD: gov)\n- .lead@odd.example (TLD: example)\n- sales@artisan.bakery.london (TLD: london)\n\nNone of these have digits in the TLD. All TLDs are alphabetic.\n\n#### Do any False examples have digits in the TLD?\n- t@1.2 (TLD: 2) -- False\n- foo@bar.c0m (TLD: c0m) -- False\n\nSo, Option A (allowing digits in TLD) does not explain the True/False split, since all True examples have alphabetic TLDs.\n\n### Step 4: What about Option B?\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (not given, but presumably a standard email format).\n\nLooking at the True examples, they all have valid-looking email addresses (with some edge cases like end.@example.com and .lead@odd.example, which are technically invalid per strict RFCs, but may be accepted by a more permissive specification).\n\nLooking at the False examples, they include:\n- marie@localhost (no TLD)\n- tim@exa_mple.co (underscore in domain)\n- t@1.2 (numeric TLD)\n- pam@-sub.domain.org (domain label starts with hyphen)\n- jane@example.c (one-letter TLD)\n- admin@mailserver1 (no TLD)\n- ro@@c.com (double @)\n- end.@example.com+ (extra character after TLD)\n- support@-broken.example (domain label starts with hyphen)\n- test@example.com. (trailing dot)\n- tom@@mail.co.uk (double @)\n- user@example.c (one-letter TLD)\n- <name@internal> (angle brackets)\n- x@y.z (one-letter TLD)\n- .lead@odd.example- (domain ends with hyphen)\n- quinn@node-.io (domain label ends with hyphen)\n- foo@bar.c0m (digit in TLD)\n- alpha@beta.-gamma.net (domain label starts with hyphen)\n- sara@domain..com (double dot)\n- abc@example,org (comma instead of dot)\n- kevin@site.cöm (non-ASCII character in TLD)\n- alan@server.cöm (non-ASCII character in TLD)\n- path@server.company- (domain ends with hyphen)\n- name@subdomain-.company (domain label ends with hyphen)\n- alice@domain (no TLD)\n\nThese are all invalid per standard email specifications.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption B is the correct rule: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the (presumably standard) email specification.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

This means Option B cannot be correct, because the rule is not \"accept TLDs with digits\"—in fact, those are always rejected.\n\nOption A fits: the rule is to accept if there is a valid email address (with a TLD of at least two letters, no digits, etc).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct answer is Option A.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

All TLDs are alphabetic, sometimes multi-part (e.g., .co.uk, .team.io, .science.pub).\n- In the False examples, some are rejected for TLDs being too short (e.g., .z), or for invalid characters (e.g., non-ASCII, underscore in domain, double dot, etc.).\n- The presence of digits in the TLD is not a distinguishing feature in the examples.\n\n#### Option B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n- The True examples all have a valid email address, with:\n  - Local part: letters, digits, dots, hyphens, underscores, plus, percent\n  - @ symbol\n  - Domain: labels separated by dots, each label starts and ends with alphanumeric, no underscores or double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens or dots, TLD at least 2 letters, only letters in TLD\n- The False examples violate these rules in various ways (invalid characters, malformed structure, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption B is the correct rule, as it matches the pattern in the examples: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address according to a standard specification.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the presence of digits in the TLD is not a factor in the examples.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

This means the rule is NOT \"accept if TLD may include digits\"—in fact, that's a reason for rejection.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the standard email specification (with a valid TLD, no digits in TLD, etc.).\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

What is the \"email specification below\"?\nFrom the examples, the accepted emails:\n- Have a local part (before the @) that can include letters, numbers, dots, hyphens, underscores, plus, and percent signs.\n- Have a domain part (after the @) that consists of labels separated by dots.\n- Each label in the domain must start and end with a letter or digit, and may contain hyphens in the middle.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) must be at least two characters, all letters (no digits).\n- No double dots, no leading/trailing dots or hyphens in any label.\n- No underscores in the domain.\n- No trailing dot after the TLD.\n\n### 2. Option B: TLD may include digits\nBut in the examples:\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident (TLD is \"c0\", contains a digit, and is marked False)\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it (TLD is \"12345\", all digits, marked False)\n- False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption (TLD is \"c0m\", contains a digit, marked False)\n\nSo, Option B is not correct, because emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### 3. Option A: At least one token matches the email specification\nThis fits the pattern: all True examples have a valid email address according to the standard specification (with the caveats above), and all False examples violate the specification in some way (invalid TLD, double dots, leading/trailing hyphens, underscores in domain, etc).\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Marked False.\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it\n  - TLD is \"12345\" (digits). Marked False.\n\nSo, Option A says \"TLD may include digits\" is accepted, but both examples with digit-only TLDs are marked False. This suggests Option A is not correct.\n\n### Step 2: Look at True examples for TLDs\n\n- True: Our CTO uses nikhil.patel@founders.lab.africa for mentoring\n  - TLD is \"africa\" (letters only)\n- True: Media inquiries: press@cityhall.ny.gov are handled daily\n  - TLD is \"gov\" (letters only)\n- True: Feedback can be sent to beta@product.preview.site without delay\n  - TLD is \"site\" (letters only)\n- True: She set reminders from schedule@daily.planner\n  - TLD is \"planner\" (letters only)\n- True: You can reach me at ALEXANDRA@CLOUD.EXPERT for the quote\n  - TLD is \"expert\" (letters only)\n\nAll True examples have TLDs with only letters.\n\n### Step 3: Look at False examples for TLDs\n\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it\n  - TLD is digits, marked False.\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\n  - TLD is digits, marked False.\n- False: Her shirt read alan@server.cöm during the parade\n  - TLD has an umlaut, marked False.\n- False: Their note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd\n  - TLD has a digit, marked False.\n\nSo, TLDs with digits or non-letters are always False.\n\n### Step 4: Look at the new example\n\n- Use jane_doe@sub_domain.org only as a placeholder\n  - The local part has an underscore, the domain has an underscore.\n  - Marked False.\n\n### Step 5: What about underscores in domain?\n\n- True: events_team@harbor.festival\n  - Local part has underscore, domain does not.\n- False: Use jane_doe@sub_domain.org only as a placeholder\n  - Both local and domain have underscores.\n\nSo, underscores in the domain are not accepted.\n\n### Step 6: Option B\n\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" Since we don't have the exact specification, but the pattern in the examples is that only standard, valid email addresses (with TLDs of only letters, no underscores in the domain, etc.) are accepted, Option B is more likely to be correct.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nOption A is contradicted by the examples with digit TLDs being marked False. Option B is more general and fits the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

the talk\n- She wrote abcdef@example.com_ on the back\n- I saw tim@exa_mple.co stuck on the monitor\n- Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage\n- Try admin@mailserver1 for internal messages\n- They printed admin@host on the wrong side\n- The note had user@domain with no suffix\n- The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere\n- The address alice@10.0.0.5 was on the whiteboard\n- He wrote t@1.2 in haste\n- There was keith@site.cömx scrawled in the notebook\n- Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\n- Ping x@y.z while testing\n- We saw name@example.com- near the footer\n- Forward to ops@site.c if you must\n- Please send to dev@-alpha.beta immediately\n\n### Step 2: What is the difference?\n\n- In True examples, the email addresses look like they follow standard email rules, including valid TLDs (e.g., .com, .org, .ai, .foundation, .gov, .photos, .supply, etc.), and the local and domain parts are valid.\n- In False examples, the email addresses are malformed in some way: invalid TLDs (e.g., .c, .12345, .9net, .cömx), invalid characters (e.g., underscores in the domain, double dots, trailing hyphens, etc.), or missing parts.\n\n### Step 3: Does the TLD include digits?\n\n- True: nikhil.patel@founders.lab.africa (TLD: .africa, no digits)\n- True: jasper.may+field@northshore.ai (TLD: .ai, no digits)\n- True: support_team@cityservices.gov (TLD: .gov, no digits)\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it (TLD: .12345, digits, but marked False)\n- False: Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples (TLD: .9net, digits, but marked False)\n- False: mail@domain.123 (TLD: .123, digits, but marked False)\n\nSo, Option A is not correct, because TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n### Step 4: What about Option B?\n\nOption B says: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nGiven that the True examples all have valid email addresses and the False ones have invalid ones, this matches the pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

All TLDs are alphabetic.\n\n### Step 3: Do any False examples have digits in the TLD?\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart (TLD: 9k)\n- False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually (TLD: 123)\n\nThese are marked False, and they have digits in the TLD.\n\n### Step 4: Are there any True examples with digits in the TLD?\nNo. All True examples have alphabetic TLDs.\n\n### Step 5: Are there False examples with alphabetic TLDs?\nYes, many. For example:\n- False: Forward to ops@site.c if you must (TLD: c, which is not a valid TLD)\n- False: We use the format name at company dot com for inquiries (not an email address)\n- False: Type sue@subdomain into the box (no TLD)\n- False: The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out (invalid domain)\n- False: She wrote abcdef@example.com_ on the back (extra underscore)\n- False: Please write to jane@example.com. when you can (trailing period)\n- False: Please don't post test@example.com. (trailing period)\n- False: Her handle was mark@sub_domain.com in the draft (underscore in domain)\n- False: Use jane_doe@sub_domain.org only as a placeholder (underscore in domain)\n- False: The document shows .lead@odd.example- near the margin (invalid domain)\n- False: They typed too many ats in ro@@c.com while rushing (double @)\n- False: The memo cited jane@example.c which isn't valid (TLD: c, not valid)\n\n### Step 6: What about Option B?\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" The True examples all have a valid email address, and the False examples either have a malformed email, an invalid TLD, or a TLD with digits, or some other error.\n\n### Step 7: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\" But the True examples never have digits in the TLD, and the False examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### Step 8: Conclusion\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification (i.e., a valid email address).\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

So Option A is not correct.\n\n### Step 4: What about Option B?\n\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n\nGiven the examples, the rule is about matching a specific email specification (which is not shown, but can be inferred from the examples). The True examples all match a strict email format, and the False ones do not.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, because the rule is about matching a specific email specification, not about TLDs with digits.\n\n{\n  \"answer\": \"B\"\n}",

So, TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- Also, \"adr@127.0.0.1\" is False, so numeric TLDs or IPs are not accepted.\n- Therefore, Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n- This is more general, and matches the pattern in the examples: the True examples all have a valid email address, and the False ones have something wrong with the email (invalid TLD, double dots, invalid characters, etc).\n- The rule is about matching a valid email address according to a certain specification (which is not fully shown, but can be inferred from the examples).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

But in the examples, emails like \"kevin@site.9net\" (False) and \"luke@site.c0\" (False) are marked as False, even though their TLDs include digits. This suggests that simply having a digit in the TLD is not enough for acceptance, and in fact, those are rejected.\n\nNow, Option B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. Since we don't have the exact specification, but the examples show that only valid, properly formatted email addresses are accepted (with some flexibility for plus, percent, hyphen, etc.), and invalid ones (with double dots, underscores in the domain, TLDs with digits, domains starting/ending with hyphens, non-ASCII, etc.) are rejected.\n\nTherefore, Option B is more likely to be correct, as it matches the pattern in the examples: only valid email addresses (according to a certain specification) are accepted.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

From the examples, we can infer that the rule is about valid email addresses, but with some stricter requirements than the standard. Let's look at the patterns in the True and False examples:\n\nPatterns in True examples:\n- The email addresses have a valid local part (before the @), which can include letters, numbers, dots, underscores, plus, and percent signs.\n- The domain part (after the @) can have multiple subdomains, separated by dots.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) is always alphabetic and at least two letters (e.g., .com, .museum, .coffee, .space, .us, .ke, .gov, .center, .ai, .io, .page, .brussels).\n- No TLDs with digits (e.g., .c0m) are accepted.\n- No TLDs with only one letter (e.g., .c) are accepted.\n- No double dots (..), no leading or trailing hyphens in domain labels, and no leading dots in the domain.\n- No non-ASCII characters in the domain or TLD.\n\nPatterns in False examples:\n- TLDs with digits (e.g., .c0m) are rejected.\n- TLDs with only one letter (e.g., .c, .z) are rejected.\n- Domains with double dots (..), leading/trailing hyphens, or leading dots are rejected.\n- Non-ASCII characters in the domain (e.g., ö) are rejected.\n- Email-like tokens that are not valid emails (e.g., missing TLD, or using at/dot instead of @/.) are rejected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts if there is at least one token matching the (implied) strict email specification.\n- This fits the True/False pattern: only valid, strictly-formed emails are accepted.\n\nOption B: Accepts if there is an email-like token whose TLD may include digits.\n- But in the examples, emails with TLDs containing digits (e.g., .c0m) are always rejected (False).

      "response": "Let's analyze the two options in light of the examples:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n- This means the rule is about the presence of a valid email address in the text, according to a certain specification (presumably a standard email format, possibly with some restrictions).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- This means the rule is about the presence of an email-like token, but specifically where the top-level domain (TLD) can include digits.\n\nLet's check the examples for evidence:\n\n1. Many True examples have email addresses with TLDs like .org, .cloud, .tools, .jobs, .edu, .de, .site, .camp, .group, .circle, .energy, etc. None of these TLDs include digits.\n2. Many False examples are rejected for malformed email addresses (e.g., double dots, leading/trailing dots or dashes, invalid characters, invalid TLDs like .c, .123, .9net, etc.).\n3. There are False examples with TLDs that include digits (e.g., mail@domain.123, admin@site.9net, root@host.123), and these are marked False.\n4. There are no True examples with TLDs that include digits.\n\nTherefore:\n- Option B cannot be correct, because emails with digit-including TLDs are always marked False.\n- Option A is consistent with the data: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address according to a certain specification (which seems to be a fairly strict interpretation of the standard, e.g., no double dots, no leading/trailing dashes or dots, no digits in TLD, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Do any False examples have digits in the TLD?\n- False: \"Notice quid@pro.qu0 with a zero at the end\" (TLD: qu0, has a digit)\n- False: \"We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\" (TLD: 9k, has a digit)\n- False: \"Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\" (TLD: 123, all digits)\n\nAll of these are marked False.\n\n### 3. Are there False examples with valid-looking emails but with other issues?\n- False: \"He scribbled john@@example.org on the napkin\" (double @)\n- False: \"There was an entry for user@sub..domain.com somewhere\" (double dot in domain)\n- False: \"Don't trust bruce@fake..domain.org ever\" (double dot in domain)\n- False: \"I saw tim@exa_mple.co stuck on the monitor\" (underscore in domain)\n- False: \"Her card read marie@localhost, nothing more\" (no TLD)\n- False: \"Contact via me@example.com.\" (trailing period)\n- False: \"Just type first.last@domain,com into the search bar\" (comma instead of dot)\n- False: \"Note that admin@domain is incomplete\" (no TLD)\n- False: \"Please write to jane@example.com. when you can\" (trailing period)\n- False: \"The formula had email@example.c_m embedded\" (underscore in TLD)\n- False: \"Saw 'dev@host' chalked on the wall\" (no TLD)\n- False: \"The memo cited jane@example.c which isn't valid\" (TLD too short)\n- False: \"The note had carol@site.c, which is too short\" (TLD too short)\n- False: \"We saw end.@example.com_ written on the board\" (underscore after .com)\n- False: \"Someone typed end.@example.com+ by accident\" (plus after .com)\n- False: \"Try name@[2001:db8::1] if the system asks\" (IP address as domain)\n\nThese are all invalid for standard email syntax reasons.\n\n### 4.

Does the rule depend on TLDs with digits?\n- All examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n- All True examples have TLDs with only letters.\n\n### 6. Does the rule depend on matching a valid email address?\n- All True examples contain a valid email address (per RFC-like rules).\n- All False examples either have a malformed email or a TLD with digits or other invalid features.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\" But all examples with digits in the TLD are marked False, so this cannot be the rule.\n\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" This matches the pattern: only valid emails (with valid TLDs, no digits, no underscores in domain, etc.) are accepted.\n\n**Therefore, the correct answer is Option A.**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

In fact, TLDs with digits are rejected.\n\n#### Option B: Must match a specific email specification\n\n- Many False examples are invalid emails (double dots, invalid TLDs, underscores in domain, etc.)\n- True examples all have valid-looking emails, with valid TLDs (all letters, at least two characters), no double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is about matching a specific, stricter email specification.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, as the True examples all match a stricter email specification, and Option A is contradicted by the data.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

The examples show that only valid, properly formatted emails are accepted, matching the standard email specification (with the caveats above).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples, Option B does not.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

The False examples violate standard email rules.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nOption A fits the data: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Comparing the options\n\n- **Option A** says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"  \n  (Assuming the \"email specification\" is a standard, valid email address with a valid TLD.)\n\n- **Option B** says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"  \n  (But all examples with digits in the TLD are rejected.)\n\n### 8. Conclusion\n\nOption B is **not** correct, because TLDs with digits are always rejected.\n\nOption A is correct, as the accepted examples all have a valid email address according to standard email rules (with a TLD of at least two letters, no digits, no underscores, no hyphens at the start or end).\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the two options and the examples step by step.\n\n**Option A:** The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nLet's break down what the examples show:\n\n### 1. TLDs with digits\n\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart  \n  (TLD is \"9k\", contains a digit, marked False)\n- False: Notice quid@pro.qu0 with a zero at the end  \n  (TLD is \"qu0\", contains a digit, marked False)\n- False: He wrote root@host.123 and hit enter  \n  (TLD is \"123\", all digits, marked False)\n- False: Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced  \n  (TLD is \"abc123\", contains digits, marked False)\n- False: Their note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd  \n  (TLD is \"c0m\", contains a digit, marked False)\n\nSo, if the TLD contains digits, the answer is always False. This means Option B is not correct, because it says the string is accepted when the TLD may include digits, but all such examples are marked False.\n\n### 2. Email specification\n\nLooking at the True examples, they all have what looks like a valid email address, with:\n- A local part (may include letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, dots, plus, percent)\n- An @ symbol\n- A domain (may include subdomains, hyphens, dots)\n- A TLD (at least two letters, only letters, no digits, no underscores, no hyphens at the start or end, no double dots, etc.)\n\nFalse examples violate these rules in various ways:\n- TLD too short (e.g., \"c\")\n- TLD contains digits or underscores\n- Double dots in domain\n- Hyphen at the start of a domain part\n- Trailing dot or underscore\n- No TLD at all\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nOption A is the correct rule: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification (which is a standard, valid email address).\n\nOption B is incorrect, as TLDs with digits are always marked False.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

From the examples, it seems to be a standard email address, with the following properties:\n- Local part (before @) can include letters, numbers, dots, dashes, underscores, and pluses.\n- Domain part (after @) can include subdomains separated by dots, with each label starting and ending with a letter or digit, and may include dashes in the middle.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) must be at least two letters, and only letters (no digits).\n- The email must not end with a period or other punctuation.\n- No double dots, no leading/trailing dashes or dots in domain labels, etc.\n\nNow, let's check the evidence for each option:\n\nOption B says: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\nBut in the examples:\n- False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually (TLD is all digits, marked False)\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it (TLD is all digits, marked False)\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart (TLD is digit+letter, marked False)\n- True: Please notify dave.oreilly@cork.arts.ie when you arrive (TLD is \"ie\", all letters, marked True)\n- True: RSVPs can go to donna.lee@alumni.ox.ac.uk by Friday (TLD is \"uk\", all letters, marked True)\n\nSo, Option B is not supported by the data, because emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\nOption A says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\nThis matches the pattern: all True examples contain a valid email address, and all False examples either have a malformed email or a valid email with a trailing period or other punctuation, or a TLD that is too short or contains digits.\n\nTherefore, Option A is correct.\n\nJSON answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

This means Option B is not correct, because it says the string is accepted when the TLD may include digits, but in the examples, those are always False.\n\n### Step 2: Check for standard email format\n\nNow, let's see if Option A fits.\n\n- True: The lab lead is at dr.m.khan@bioinformatics.center on weekdays\n  - Standard email format, valid TLD → True\n\n- True: Address the package to shipping@warehouse.global and include the code\n  - Standard email format, valid TLD → True\n\n- True: Questions are welcome at end.@example.com during the webinar\n  - Standard email format, valid TLD → True\n\n- True: For tickets, email boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk today\n  - Standard email format, valid TLD → True\n\n- True: The form auto-sends to forms@digital.city.brussels\n  - Standard email format, valid TLD → True\n\n- False: Please write to jane@example.com. when you can\n  - The email is followed by a period, but the email itself is valid. However, the period is outside the email, so maybe the rule is strict about punctuation.\n\n- False: The tip mentioned bob@example..net in parentheses\n  - Double dot in domain, invalid email → False\n\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it\n  - TLD is all digits, invalid → False\n\n- False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n  - TLD contains a digit, invalid → False\n\n- False: The fake one was name@-dash-.com inserted as an example\n  - Domain starts/ends with dash, invalid → False\n\n- True: Email anna@xn--bcher-kva.de for book club details\n  - Punycode domain, valid → True\n\nSo, Option A fits: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches a standard, valid email address format.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption A fits all the True/False examples, while Option B is contradicted by the False examples with digits in the TLD.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

The False cases violate these rules (e.g., invalid TLD, double dots, leading/trailing hyphens or dots, underscores in the domain, digits in the TLD, etc.).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A is correct, as it matches the pattern in the examples.

digits.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples and see which rule fits better.\n\n### Step 1: Check for TLDs with digits\n\nLook at the True examples:\n- \"Contact me at jasper.may+field@northshore.ai before noon\" (TLD: ai, no digits)\n- \"Welcome notes should go to greetings@community.center\" (TLD: center, no digits)\n- \"Hiring panel: panel@interviews.panelists.network\" (TLD: network, no digits)\n- \"office@rail.workers.union\" (TLD: union, no digits)\n- \"ux@studio-seven.design\" (TLD: design, no digits)\n- \"alerts+night@ops.team.io\" (TLD: io, no digits)\n- \"badges@annual.conference\" (TLD: conference, no digits)\n- \"photocopy@library.department.university\" (TLD: university, no digits)\n- \"signups@cleanup.river.earth\" (TLD: earth, no digits)\n- \"dave.oreilly@cork.arts.ie\" (TLD: ie, no digits)\n- \"hr@company-name.co.ke\" (TLD: ke, no digits)\n- \"dev@kernel.space\" (TLD: space, no digits)\n- \"drivers@shared.bike.city\" (TLD: city, no digits)\n- \"stewards@stadium.safety\" (TLD: safety, no digits)\n- \"info@book-club.museum\" (TLD: museum, no digits)\n- \"signup@city.walks\" (TLD: walks, no digits)\n- \"gardener@community.garden\" (TLD: garden, no digits)\n- \"records@st-mary.hospital\" (TLD: hospital, no digits)\n- \"updates@software.release.channel\" (TLD: channel, no digits)\n- \"rohan@cafe.example\" (TLD: example, no digits)\n- \"care-team@pets.healthcare\" (TLD: healthcare, no digits)\n- \"hello@green.energy\" (TLD: energy, no digits)\n- \"boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk\" (TLD: uk, no digits)\n- \"tickets@downtown.cinema.today\" (TLD: today, no digits)\n- \"sponsor@open-source.foundation\" (TLD: foundation, no digits)\n- \"ledger@accounting.toolsuite.cloud\" (TLD: cloud, no digits)\n- \"editors@literary.review.magazine\" (TLD: magazine, no digits)\n- \"end.@example.com during the webinar\" (TLD: com, no digits)\n- \"Email jane-doe@northwest.trails.club to join\" (TLD: club, no digits)\n\nNone of the True examples have a TLD with digits.\n\nNow, look at the False examples:\n- \"Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\" (TLD: 9net, has a digit) — Marked False.\n- \"Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\" (TLD: c0m, has a digit) — Marked False.\n- \"The note had user@domain with no suffix\" (no TLD) — Marked False.\n- \"The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out\" (xn-- is not a valid domain) — Marked False.\n- \"Their note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd\" (TLD: c0m, has a digit) — Marked False.\n- \"Notice quid@pro.qu0 with a zero at the end\" (TLD: qu0, has a digit) — Marked False.\n- \"Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\" (TLD: 123, all digits) — Marked False.\n\nSo, in fact, all examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### Step 2: Check for standard email specification\n\nNow, let's see if the True examples all have a valid email address according to standard rules (RFC 5322, simplified):\n\n- local-part@domain\n- local-part: letters, digits, dots, hyphens, underscores, plus\n- domain: labels separated by dots, each label starts and ends with letter/digit, can have hyphens in the middle, TLD is at least 2 letters, only letters (no digits in TLD for these examples)\n\nAll True examples fit this pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Check for False examples that would be accepted by Option A\n\nLook at some False examples:\n- \"We saw name@example.com- near the footer\" (extra hyphen after .com, not a valid email)\n- \"The note had user@domain with no suffix\" (no TLD, not valid)\n- \"Ping x@y.z while testing\" (TLD: z, only one letter, not valid)\n- \"The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out\" (xn-- is not a valid label by itself)\n- \"He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed\" (TLD: c, only one letter, not valid)\n- \"Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage\" (double dot, not valid)\n- \"The old wiki uses joe at domain dot com for privacy\" (not an email, just words)\n- \"The sketch shows team_leads@example.com- on the page\" (extra hyphen after .com, not valid)\n- \"She kept using root@-host-name.com despite the errors\" (label starts with hyphen, not valid)\n- \"Their note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd\" (TLD: c0m, not valid)\n- \"Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\" (TLD: c0m, not valid)\n- \"Just type name@example,com in the browser\" (comma instead of dot, not valid)\n- \"Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\" (TLD: 9net, not valid)\n- \"This line had example@.co.uk which cannot work\" (label starts with dot, not valid)\n- \"We saw abc@def.com_ on a sticker\" (underscore after .com, not valid)\n- \"They used name@subdomain- in the emails\" (label ends with hyphen, not valid)\n- \"Contact via me@example.com.\" (period after .com, not valid)\n- \"Type sue@subdomain into the box\" (no TLD, not valid)\n- \"I saw tim@exa_mple.co stuck on the monitor\" (underscore in domain, not valid)\n- \"Notice quid@pro.qu0 with a zero at the end\" (TLD: qu0, not valid)\n- \"Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\" (TLD: 123, not valid)\n- \"Avoid using tom@@mail.co.uk, it's malformed\" (double @, not valid)\n- \"The fake one was name@-dash-.com inserted as an example\" (label starts/ends with hyphen, not valid)\n- \"We saw end.@example.com_ written on the board\" (underscore after .com, not valid)\n- \"The tip mentioned bob@example..net in parentheses\" (double dot, not valid)\n- \"Use 'first.last@example.com.' at most once\" (period after .com, not valid)\n- \"They printed admin@host on the wrong side\" (no TLD, not valid)\n- \"Her shirt read alan@server.cöm during the parade\" (non-ASCII character in TLD, not valid)\n- \"They mentioned user@example.c in passing\" (TLD: c, not valid)\n- \"Her handle was mark@sub_domain.com in the draft\" (underscore in domain, not valid)\n- \"The memo cited jane@example.c which isn't valid\" (TLD: c, not valid)\n- \"Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver\" (double dot, not valid)\n\nAll of these are not valid emails according to the standard specification.\n\n### Step 4: The new example\n\n\"Email jane-doe@northwest.trails.club to join\" — This is a valid email address according to the standard specification.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption A is correct: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (i.e., a valid email address).\n\nOption B is incorrect, because TLDs with digits are always marked False.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

False Examples\n\n- Type sue@subdomain into the box\n- They typed too many ats in ro@@c.com while rushing\n- The memo cited jane@example.c which isn't valid\n- Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver\n- The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out\n- The test had name@example.12345 in it\n- He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed\n- A misprint read mail@example.c_m in the report\n- He typed root@host.123 and hit enter\n- They mentioned user@example.c in passing\n- Please don't post test@example.com.\n- He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\n- Forward to ops@site.c if you must\n- We saw end.@example.com_ written on the board\n- It read tom.sawyer at river.org in the notes\n- Please write to jane@example.com. when you can\n- It mistakenly showed abc@.bad.tld in the draft\n- They displayed pam@-sub.domain.org on the slide\n- That slide showed adr@127.0.0.1 during the talk\n- Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n- We saw name@example.com- near the footer\n- We use the format name at company dot com for inquiries\n- Just type name@example,com in the browser\n- The banner had sales@site.-zone.com printed on it\n- Her notes included joe@example.com_ at the end\n- Send a note to bob@.example.com after the meeting\n- We saw abc@def.com_ on a sticker\n- The old wiki uses joe at domain dot com for privacy\n- She wrote dev@host..name.net and then erased it\n\n### 3. Analysis\n\n#### Option B: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits\"\n- False examples: name@example.12345, root@host.123, betty@site.c0m, luke@site.c0\n- These are all marked False, which suggests that TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n- True examples: All have TLDs that are alphabetic (e.g., .com, .org, .design, .photos, .zone, .au, .news, .classes, etc.)\n- So, Option B is NOT correct, because the rule is not about allowing digits in the TLD.\n\n#### Option A: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below\"\n- The True examples all have a valid email address (with a valid TLD, no double dots, no invalid characters, etc.)\n- The False examples are either malformed emails (double dots, invalid TLDs, TLDs with digits, underscores in TLD, etc.) or not emails at all.\n- This matches the pattern: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address.\n\n### 4.

However, from the examples, we can infer that the rule is about a specific, stricter email format.\n\nLet's look at the patterns in the True and False examples:\n\n### True Examples:\n- The email addresses are of the form: local-part@subdomain.domain.tld (sometimes with multiple subdomains, sometimes with a percent sign in the local part, sometimes with hyphens and underscores).\n- The TLD (top-level domain) is always alphabetic and at least two characters (e.g., .center, .org, .dev, .group, .community, .network, .arts, .ie, .hospital, .gov, .cloud, .coffee, .de, .toolsuite.cloud, .pipeline.tech, etc.).\n- No True example has a TLD with digits (e.g., .c0m, .123, .9k, .c0, .12345, etc.).\n- No True example has a TLD of only one character (e.g., .c).\n- No True example has malformed email addresses (e.g., double @, trailing punctuation, leading hyphens in domain, underscores in domain, etc.).\n\n### False Examples:\n- Many have TLDs with digits (e.g., .c0m, .123, .9k, .c0, .12345).\n- Some have TLDs of only one character (e.g., .c).\n- Some have malformed email addresses (e.g., double @, trailing punctuation, leading hyphens in domain, underscores in domain, etc.).\n- Some are not email addresses at all.\n\n### Option A Analysis:\n- Option A says the string is accepted if it contains an email-like token whose TLD may include digits.\n- But in the True examples, there are **no TLDs with digits**. In fact, all True examples have TLDs that are alphabetic and at least two characters.\n- In the False examples, the presence of digits in the TLD is a reason for rejection.\n\n### Option B Analysis:\n- Option B says the string is accepted if it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (not shown, but inferred to be stricter than just \"email-like\").\n- From the examples, the specification seems to be: a valid email address with a TLD of at least two alphabetic characters, no digits in the TLD, no leading/trailing hyphens or underscores in the domain, no double @, etc.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Option A is **not** correct, because True examples never have digits in the TLD, and False examples often do.\n- Option B is correct, as it matches the observed pattern: only strings with a valid email address (with a TLD of at least two alphabetic characters, no digits, etc.) are accepted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

What is the \"email specification below\" in Option A?\nFrom the examples, the accepted emails:\n- Have a local part (can include dots, plus, underscores, percent, hyphens)\n- Have an @\n- Have a domain part (can include dots, hyphens, but not start/end with hyphen or dot, no consecutive dots)\n- The TLD (last part after the last dot) is at least two letters, only letters (no digits)\n- No underscores in the domain\n- No invalid characters or formats (e.g., double @, missing TLD, etc.)\n\n### 2.

Option A: At least one token matches the email specification\nThis fits the pattern: all True examples have a valid email address according to standard rules (RFC-like, but with some flexibility in local part), and all False examples violate some part of the email specification (e.g., invalid TLD, invalid characters, missing TLD, etc.)\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is correct, as it matches the pattern in the examples.

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nWe don't have the \"email specification below\" explicitly, but from the examples, we can infer what is and isn't accepted.\n\nLet's look at the True and False examples and see which rule fits better.\n\n### Analysis of Option A\n\nOption A says the only requirement is that the email-like token's top-level domain (TLD) may include digits. Let's see if this fits:\n\n- True: \"qa-team@builds.internal.tools\" (TLD is \"tools\", no digits, but accepted)\n- True: \"ALEXANDRA@CLOUD.EXPERT\" (TLD is \"expert\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"jasper.may+field@northshore.ai\" (TLD is \"ai\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"alerts+night@ops.team.io\" (TLD is \"io\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"test%beta@lab.testing.zone\" (TLD is \"zone\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"deploy%stable@release.track.dev\" (TLD is \"dev\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"chair@trustees.foundation\" (TLD is \"foundation\", no digits, accepted)\n- True: \"charlotte.h@north.town.news\" (TLD is \"news\", no digits, accepted)\n\nBut also, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- False: \"kevin@site.9net\" (TLD is \"9net\", includes a digit, but marked False)\n- False: \"root@host.123\" (TLD is \"123\", all digits, marked False)\n- False: \"fiona@server-.net\" (TLD is \"net\", no digits, but marked False due to the hyphen before the dot)\n- False: \"abc@def.com_\" (TLD is \"com_\", includes an underscore, marked False)\n\nSo, Option A is not sufficient, because some emails with digits in the TLD are marked False, and many accepted emails have TLDs without digits.\n\n### Analysis of Option B\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. From the examples, we can infer that the email specification is stricter than just \"email-like\" and includes rules such as:\n\n- No leading or trailing hyphens in domain labels.\n- No consecutive dots.\n- TLD must be at least two letters, only letters (no digits or underscores).\n- No underscores in the domain part.\n- No invalid characters in the domain or TLD.\n- Local part can include dots, plus, percent, and underscores, but not consecutive dots or invalid characters.\n\nLet's check some True and False examples with this in mind:\n\n- True: \"jasper.may+field@northshore.ai\" (valid email, matches spec)\n- False: \"kevin@site.9net\" (TLD has a digit, not allowed)\n- False: \"root@host.123\" (TLD is all digits, not allowed)\n- False: \"abc@def.com_\" (TLD has an underscore, not allowed)\n- False: \"fiona@server-.net\" (domain label ends with hyphen, not allowed)\n- False: \"quinn@node-.io\" (domain label ends with hyphen, not allowed)\n- False: \"abc@.bad.tld\" (domain label starts with dot, not allowed)\n- False: \"user@sub..domain.com\" (consecutive dots, not allowed)\n- True: \"alerts+night@ops.team.io\" (valid email, matches spec)\n- True: \"charlotte.h@north.town.news\" (valid email, matches spec)\n\nThis matches the pattern of the True and False examples.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, as the examples are classified based on whether the string contains a token that matches a strict email specification, not just whether the TLD can have digits.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

TLD is too short (a@b.c)\n  - TLD contains digits (foo@bar.c0m, quid@pro.qu0, site.9net, yy.9k)\n  - TLD contains non-ASCII (site.cömx)\n  - Double dots (user@example..co.uk, bruce@fake..domain.org, sara@domain..com)\n  - Domain starts or ends with a dash (name@-dash-.com, root@-host-name.com, name@subdomain-.company, dev@-alpha.beta)\n  - Not a valid email format (name[at]company[dot]org, name at company dot com, <name@internal>, [contact@example.org.])\n  - TLD is missing or too short (admin@host, tiny@big.c, zz@yy.9k, y@x.z)\n  - IP address as domain (name@[2001:db8::1])\n\n**Option B** says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n- But in the False examples, addresses like foo@bar.c0m, quid@pro.qu0, site.9net, yy.9k are all marked False. This means that TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n\n**Option A** says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n- The True examples all have at least one valid email address.\n- The False examples either have invalid email addresses or none at all.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is correct, because the True examples all contain at least one valid email address, and the False examples do not. Option B is incorrect, because TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Option A: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits\"\n- Many True examples have TLDs with only letters (e.g., .com, .org, .ai, .gov, .edu, .club, .camp, .news, .space, .foundation, .collective, .events, .io, .net, .ai, .tools, .london, .alumni, .example, .hotel, .africa, .org, .dev, .light, .brussels, .uk, .art, .ke, .magazine, .zone, .circle, .ie, .org, .theatre, .design, .portal, .life, .center, .de).\n- There are no True examples with digits in the TLD (e.g., .c0m, .net2, etc.).\n- There are False examples with TLDs that are too short (e.g., x@y.z, which is False).\n- There are False examples with TLDs that are only one letter (e.g., x@y.z, y@x.z).\n- There are False examples with TLDs that are malformed (e.g., .c, .co..jp, .com., .com-, .-.company, .-sub.domain.org, .cömx, .xn--.net, .node-.io, .bad-.co.uk, .9net).\n- The True example \"anna@xn--bcher-kva.de\" uses an IDN (internationalized domain name) in punycode, which is valid.\n\n#### 2. Option B: \"matches the email specification below\"\n- This is more general, but the key is that the email must match a specific, presumably correct, email specification.\n- The False examples are all cases where the email is malformed in some way (double dots, leading/trailing dots or hyphens, invalid characters, TLD too short, etc.).\n- The True examples are all valid emails according to the standard email specification (RFC 5322, with some practical restrictions).\n\n#### 3. Comparing the options:\n- Option A focuses on TLDs with digits, but none of the True examples have digits in the TLD. In fact, the False example \"kevin@site.9net\" is rejected, which suggests that TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- Option B is about matching a correct email specification, which fits all the True and False examples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is the correct rule, as it matches the pattern in the examples: only valid, properly formatted email addresses are accepted, and those with malformed structure, invalid characters, or invalid TLDs are rejected.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

These have digits in the TLD, so Option A would incorrectly accept them.\n\n#### Option B: Accepts only if the email matches a specific specification (not fully detailed here, but implied by the examples).\n- The True examples all have valid emails according to standard email rules (RFC-like), with TLDs of at least two letters, no digits or special characters in the TLD, no leading/trailing dots or hyphens, etc.\n- The False examples violate these rules in various ways.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, because the True examples only accept emails that match a stricter, standard-like email specification, and reject those with digits in the TLD or other invalid forms. Option A is incorrect because it would accept emails with digits in the TLD, which are marked False in the examples.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

So, TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n- In the True examples, all TLDs are alphabetic (e.g., .com, .net, .biz, .care, .portal, .cloud, .work, .supply, etc.)\n\n#### Option B: Requires a token that matches a specific email specification\n- The True examples all have valid-looking email addresses.\n- The False examples have issues like:\n  - Double dots in the domain (user@sub..domain.com)\n  - Invalid characters in the domain (exa_mple)\n  - TLDs that are too short (jane@example.c)\n  - TLDs with digits (luke@site.c0, kevin@site.9net)\n  - Domains ending with a hyphen (team_leads@example.com-)\n  - Domains starting with a dot or hyphen (.lead@odd.example-, support@-broken.example)\n  - Non-ASCII characters (kevin@site.cöm)\n  - Trailing punctuation (jane@example.com., abcdef@example.com_)\n  - IP addresses as domains (alice@10.0.0.5)\n  - Domains with double dots (user@example..co.uk)\n  - Domains with underscores (someone@exa_mple.co.uk)\n  - Domains with invalid TLDs (jane@example.c, email@example.c_m)\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address according to a standard specification (e.g., RFC 5322, but with some restrictions, such as TLDs must be alphabetic and at least two letters).\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption A is incorrect because TLDs with digits are not accepted.\nOption B is correct because the True examples all have valid email addresses, and the False examples do not.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

explicitly, but from the examples, we can infer what is and isn't accepted.\n\nLet's look at the True and False examples:\n\n### True Examples:\n- He created a group at study-circle@evening.classes\n- Direct your request to pm@node42.research.net by 5 pm\n- For domain issues email dns-admin@registry.internet\n- The form auto-sends to forms@digital.city.brussels\n- The maintainer is reachable at

week\n- Join via signup@city.walks\n\n### False Examples:\n- This line had example@.co.uk which cannot work\n- Please send to dev@-alpha.beta immediately\n- He scratched out cc@site..org mid-meeting\n- They used name@subdomain- in the emails\n- We saw 'mail@domain..org' buried in the text\n- The note had user@domain with no suffix\n- The note had carol@site.c, which is too short\n- The document shows .lead@odd.example- near the margin\n- The fake address was a@b.c which is not accepted\n- Contact via me@example.com.\n- The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out\n- Oddly, the sticker said path@server.company- near the margin\n- The QR code expanded to quinn@node-.io eventually\n- Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage\n- We told them to avoid alice@domain when sharing\n- Don't trust bruce@fake..domain.org ever\n- Ping x@y.z while testing\n- Forward to ops@site.c if you must\n- It read tom.sawyer at river.org in the notes\n- They printed admin@host on the wrong side\n- Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver\n- Try admin@mailserver1 for internal messages\n- They used [contact@example.org.] but that dot breaks it\n- We saw abc@def.com_ on a sticker\n- They proposed name@subdomain-.company as a placeholder\n- A misprint read mail@example.c_m in the report\n- Use 'first.last@example.com.' at most once\n- Please don't use someone@exa_mple.co.uk anymore\n- We saw name@example.com- near the footer\n- Her handle was mark@sub_domain.com in the draft\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Option A: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits\"\n- There are no True examples with digits in the TLD, but there are True examples with TLDs like \".co.ke\", \".brussels\", \".company\", \".foundation\", \".news\", \".pub\", \".london\", \".jobs\", \".design\", \".chain\", \".space\", \".community\", \".care\", \".shop\", \".planner\", \".tools\", \".science\", \".walks\", \".net\", \".org\", \".com\", \".ke\", \".news\", \".foundation\", \".city\", \".pool\", \".board\", \".department\", \".university\", \".research\", \".internet\", \".example\", \".art\", \".bike\", \".panelists\", \".network\", \".digital\", \".city\", \".brussels\", \".modern\", \".art\", \".kernel\", \".space\", \".review\", \".board\", \".org\", \".cafe\", \".example\", \".customer\", \".care\", \".qa\", \".alpha\", \".beta\", \".company\", \".room\", \".news-example\", \".com\", \".stadium\", \".safety\", \".studio-seven\", \".design\", \".recruiter\", \".talent\", \".pool\", \".jobs\", \".lead\", \".odd\", \".example\", \".journals\", \".open\", \".science\", \".pub\", \".sales\", \".artisan\", \".bakery\", \".london\", \".charlotte.h\", \".north\", \".town\", \".news\", \".sponsor\", \".open-source\", \".foundation\", \".hr\", \".company-name\", \".co\", \".ke\", \".signup\", \".city\", \".walks\".\n\n- There are no True examples with digits in the TLD, but there are False examples with TLDs that are too short (e.g., \".c\"), or with numbers in the domain (e.g., \"node42\"), but not in the TLD.\n\n- There are False examples with TLDs like \".123\" (False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually), which suggests that TLDs with only digits are not accepted.\n\n#### Option B: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below\"\n- The True examples all have valid-looking email addresses, with:\n  - A local part (may include dots, plus, percent, hyphen, etc.)\n  - An @ symbol\n  - A domain part (may include hyphens, dots, but not consecutive dots, not starting or ending with hyphen or dot)\n  - A TLD of at least two letters (no single-letter TLDs, no TLDs with only digits, no underscores in domain or TLD, no trailing punctuation)\n  - No consecutive dots in domain\n  - No leading or trailing hyphens or dots in domain or TLD\n  - No underscores in domain or TLD\n  - No trailing punctuation (e.g., dot or dash at the end)\n  - No multiple @ symbols\n\n- The False examples violate these rules in various ways: consecutive dots, missing TLD, TLD too short, trailing punctuation, underscores in domain, multiple @ symbols, etc.\n\n#### The new example: \"They typed too many ats in ro@@c.com while rushing\"\n- This is marked False, which matches the pattern that multiple @ symbols are not allowed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is too vague and does not explain the rejection of emails with TLDs that are only digits, or the other detailed requirements.\n\nOption B, which refers to a specific email specification, matches the observed pattern: only strings containing a valid email address (according to a strict specification) are accepted.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer

What is the \"email specification below\"?\nFrom the True examples, the accepted emails:\n- Have a local part (before the @) that can include letters, digits, underscores, dots, plus, percent, and hyphens.\n- The domain part (after the @) is made up of labels separated by dots, each label starting and ending with a letter or digit, and may include hyphens in the middle.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) is at least two letters long and only contains letters (e.g., .com, .org, .io, .cloud, .news, .co.uk, etc.).\n- No double dots, no leading/trailing dots or hyphens in domain labels, no underscores in domain, no digits-only TLDs, no TLDs with digits or underscores.\n\n### 2. Option B: TLD may include digits\n- False: The test had name@example.12345 in it (TLD is all digits, marked False)\n- False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter (TLD is all digits, marked False)\n- False: Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced (TLD has digits, marked False)\n- False: The formula had email@example.c_m embedded (TLD has underscore, marked False)\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident (TLD has digit, marked False)\n\nSo, Option B is not supported by the data, as emails with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### 3.

True: Please write to recruiter@talent.pool.jobs for referrals\n   - TLD: jobs (no digits)\n2. True: Kindly write to info@book-club.museum about the exhibit\n   - TLD: museum (no digits)\n3. True: The address to use is ops-team@night.shift.work\n   - TLD: work (no digits)\n4. False: Please don't post test@example.com.\n   - TLD: com (no digits), but it's marked False. Why? The period at the end is not part of the email, but perhaps the rule is stricter.\n5. True: For patient records, contact records@st-mary.hospital directly\n   - TLD: hospital (no digits)\n6. False: The whiteboard had fiona@server-.net scrawled on it\n   - TLD: net (no digits), but the domain has a trailing hyphen, which is invalid in email specs.\n7. False: Please don't use someone@exa_mple.co.uk anymore\n   - The domain has an underscore, which is not allowed in domain names.\n\nNow, let's look at some with digits in the TLD or domain:\n\n- False: Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\n  - TLD: 9net (has a digit), but it's marked False.\n- True: Direct your request to pm@node42.research.net by 5 pm\n  - Domain: node42 (has digits), TLD: net (no digits), marked True.\n\nSo, Option A (allowing digits in TLD) does not explain the False for kevin@site.9net, nor does it explain the True for pm@node42.research.net (where the digit is in the subdomain, not the TLD).\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples with double dots, trailing hyphens, or other invalid email features:\n\n- False: He sent mail to user@example..com, then sighed (double dot in domain)\n- False: The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out (invalid domain)\n- False: The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere (domain starts with hyphen)\n- False: There was keith@site.cömx scrawled in the notebook (non-ASCII character in TLD)\n- False: Please don't use someone@exa_mple.co.uk anymore (underscore in domain)\n- False: Oddly, the sticker said path@server.company- near the margin (domain ends with hyphen)\n- False: The demo showed alpha@beta.-gamma.net on screen (subdomain starts with hyphen)\n- False: Their sign said alpha@beta.gamma. which was wrong (trailing dot)\n- False: Please send to dev@-alpha.beta immediately (subdomain starts with hyphen)\n- False: That slide showed adr@127.0.0.1 during the talk (IP address as domain)\n- False: Saw 'dev@host' chalked on the wall (no TLD)\n- False: Address: michael@somewhere..co.jp is not acceptable (double dot in domain)\n- False: There was an entry for user@sub..domain.com somewhere (double dot in domain)\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident (TLD is c0, has a digit, marked False)\n\nFrom these, it is clear that the rule is not simply about allowing digits in the TLD (Option A), but about matching a stricter email specification (Option B), which disallows things like double dots, underscores in the domain, non-ASCII characters, domains starting or ending with hyphens, and TLDs with digits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

in the domain, double dots, or other invalid characters.\n- Some True examples have TLDs like \".io\", \".co.uk\", \".brussels\", \".light\", \".gov\", \".edu\", \".shop\", \".network\", \".city\", \".zone\", \".jobs\", \".design\", \".supply\", \".alumni\", \".finance\", \".africa\", etc.\n- The TLDs in True examples are always at least two characters long and only contain letters (no digits in TLDs in True examples).\n\n### Step 3: Do any True examples have digits in the TLD?\n\nLet's check:\n- \".io\", \".co.uk\", \".brussels\", \".light\", \".gov\", \".edu\", \".shop\", \".network\", \".city\", \".zone\", \".jobs\", \".design\", \".supply\", \".alumni\", \".finance\", \".africa\", \".com\", \".net\", \".org\", \".pub\", \".channel\", \".portal\", \".planners\", \".panelists\", \".tools\", \".release\", \".internal\", \".garden\", \".company\", \".review\", \".magazine\", \".science\", \".daily\", \".seven\", \".hardware\", \".east\", \".river\", \".startup\", \".capital\", \".party-planners\", \".news-example\", \".founders\", \".lab\", \".hackathon\", \".winter-valley\", \".builds\", \".digital\", \".cityservices\", \".paper-trail\", \".artisan\", \".bakery\", \".london\", \".registry\", \".internet\", \".rail\", \".workers\", \".union\", \".acme-holdings\", \".test\", \".beta\", \".lab\", \".testing\", \".room\", \".press\", \".ux\", \".studio\", \".connect\", \".ir\", \".nikhil.patel\", \".founders.lab.africa\"\n\nNone of these TLDs have digits.\n\n### Step 4: Do any False examples have digits in the TLD?\n\n- \"roger@host.abc123\" (False) -- TLD is \"abc123\" (has digits)\n- \"t@1.2\" (False) -- TLD is \"2\" (has digits)\n- \"x@y.z\" (False) -- TLD is \"z\" (single letter)\n- \"tiny@big.c\" (False) -- TLD is \"c\" (single letter)\n- \"carol@site.c\" (False) -- TLD is \"c\" (single letter)\n- \"ops@site.c\" (False) -- TLD is \"c\" (single letter)\n- \"jane@example.c\" (False) -- TLD is \"c\" (single letter)\n\nSo, False examples include TLDs with digits and TLDs with only one letter.\n\n### Step 5: Does Option A fit?\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nBut in the True examples, there are no TLDs with digits. In False examples, TLDs with digits are rejected.\n\nSo Option A is not correct.\n\n### Step 6: Does Option B fit?\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nGiven that the True examples all have valid email addresses (with TLDs at least two letters, no digits in TLD, no underscores in domain, etc.), and the False examples violate standard email rules, Option B is more likely.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

sticker\n- The test had name@example.12345 in it\n- The note had carol@site.c, which is too short\n- The engineer wrote dev@xn--.net and crossed it out\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Option A: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits\"\n- Many False examples have digits in the TLD (e.g., betty@site.c0m, roger@host.abc123, root@host.123, mail@domain.123, name@example.12345, kevin@site.9net), and these are marked False.\n- Many True examples have TLDs with only letters (e.g., .com, .org, .ai, .gov, .cloud, .shop, .work, .ke, .au, .ie, .uk, .de, .ai, .photos, .center, .toolsuite, .pipeline, .life, .today, .biz, .conference, .planner, .site, .club, .collective, .cinema, .market, .city, .earth, .gov, .edu, .ai, .cloud, .dev, .gov, .hotel, .work, .ke).\n- There are no True examples with digits in the TLD.\n- So, Option A is not correct, because the True examples do not have digits in the TLD, and the False examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n#### Option B: \"at least one token that matches the email specification below\"\n- The True examples all have a valid email address, with a valid local part, an @, a valid domain, and a TLD of at least two letters (no digits).\n- The False examples violate standard email rules: TLD too short (one letter), TLD has digits, domain starts with a hyphen, double dots, invalid characters, etc.\n- The True examples are all valid according to the standard email specification (RFC 5322, with some practical restrictions like TLDs being at least two letters and only letters).\n- The False examples are not valid according to the standard email specification.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nOption A is incorrect, because the True examples do not have digits in the TLD, and the False examples with digits in the TLD are marked False.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

All TLDs are alphabetic (e.g., .tech, .jobs, .page, .garden, .de, .uk, .com, .shop, .bike, .community, .channel, .theatre, .union, .pub, .directory, .brussels, .energy, .group, .cloud, .org, .news, .zone, .events, .london, .au, .dev, .systems).\n- In the False examples, we see zz@yy.9k (TLD is 9k), root@host.123 (TLD is 123), quid@pro.qu0 (TLD is qu0), which are all False.\n- So, Option B does not fit the True examples, and the False examples with digit TLDs are not accepted.\n\n#### Option A: At least one valid email token\n- The True examples all contain a valid email address.\n- The False examples are all invalid emails for various reasons: leading/trailing hyphens, underscores in domain, missing TLD, double dots, invalid characters, TLD too short, TLD with digits, etc.\n- This matches the pattern: only valid emails are accepted.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

Examples with digits in TLD\n- False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\n- False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n- False: Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\n- False: We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\n- False: The banner had sales@site.-zone.com printed on it (not a digit, but a hyphen in TLD)\n\nAll of these are marked False, even though the TLD contains digits. This suggests that **Option B** is not correct, because if it were, these would be True.\n\n### 2. Examples with valid-looking emails\n- True: Vendor forms should be sent to ap@downtown-market.biz\n- True: Feedback can be sent to beta@product.preview.site without delay\n- True: Please forward to grants@science-funding.org ASAP\n- True: Upload logs to alerts+night@ops.team.io right after the test\n\nThese are all marked True, and they all contain a valid email address.\n\n### 3. Examples with invalid email formats\n- False: She wrote abcdef@example.com_ on the back (extra underscore at the end)\n- False: The whiteboard had fiona@server-.net scrawled on it (hyphen at end of domain label)\n- False: He wrote <name@internal> and closed the angle (not a valid email)\n- False: The note had carol@site.c, which is too short (TLD too short)\n- False: Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver (double dot)\n- False: There was an entry for user@sub..domain.com somewhere (double dot)\n- False: The banner had sales@site.-zone.com printed on it (hyphen at start of TLD)\n\nThese are all marked False, and they all have invalid email formats.\n\n### 4. Option A's \"email specification below\"\nThe original prompt says \"matches the email specification below,\" which is not given, but from the examples, it seems to be a standard, valid email address (with a valid TLD, no double dots, no invalid characters, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is supported by the data: the string is accepted if it contains a valid email address. Option B is contradicted by the False examples with digits in the TLD.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

This suggests that TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n\n#### Option B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n- Since we don't have the exact specification, but the True examples all match a standard email format (with alphabetic TLDs, no double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens or dots, etc.), this seems to fit.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption A is contradicted by the False examples with digits in the TLD.\nOption B is supported by the pattern in the True examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Option A is not correct, because TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

The False examples violate the email specification in various ways (invalid TLD, consecutive dots, IP address, etc.).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nOption A is correct, as it matches the pattern in the examples. Option B is incorrect, as emails with digits in the TLD are not accepted.\n\n---\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

If not, it's rejected (False).\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- This means: If there is an email-like token, and the TLD (top-level domain) can have digits, it's accepted.\n\nLet's look at the examples:\n\n1. **True:** For press queries use press%room@news-example.com during business hours\n   - Valid email: press%room@news-example.com (TLD: com, no digits)\n2. **True:** For badges, contact badges@annual.conference\n   - Valid email: badges@annual.conference (TLD: conference, no digits)\n3. **False:** He jotted kevin@site.cöm on the corner of the page\n   - TLD: cöm (contains ö, not valid ASCII TLD)\n4. **True:** The form auto-sends to forms@digital.city.brussels\n   - TLD: brussels (no digits)\n5. **False:** We saw 'mail@domain..org' buried in the text\n   - Double dot in domain, invalid email\n6. **False:** Just type name@example,com in the browser\n   - Comma instead of dot, invalid email\n7. **False:** The document shows .lead@odd.example- near the margin\n   - Domain ends with hyphen, invalid\n8. **False:** This line had example@.co.uk which cannot work\n   - Domain starts with dot, invalid\n9. **False:** They mentioned user@example.c in passing\n   - TLD is only one character, invalid\n10. **False:** The fake address was a@b.c which is not accepted\n    - TLD is only one character, invalid\n11. **False:** The test had name@example.12345 in it\n    - TLD is all digits, invalid\n\nNow, let's check Option B: \"whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n- But in the examples, \"name@example.12345\" is marked False, even though the TLD is digits. This means Option B cannot be correct, because the presence of digits in the TLD does not make it accepted.\n\nOption A is more general: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\" The examples are consistent with this: only valid emails (according to a standard specification) are accepted.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nWe don't have the \"email specification below\" in the prompt, but let's see what the examples suggest.\n\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n#### 1. What do the True examples have in common?\n\n- They all contain something that looks like an email address.\n- The domain part can have multiple subdomains (e.g., admin@book.readers.group, donna.lee@alumni.ox.ac.uk).\n- The TLD can be more than two or three letters (e.g., .london, .cloud, .museum, .finance, .systems, .foundation, .design, .io, .app, .au).\n- Some have non-standard TLDs (e.g., .bike, .news, .group, .care, .page).\n- Some have IDN (internationalized domain names) in punycode (e.g., anna@xn--bcher-kva.de).\n- Some have percent signs in the local part (e.g., archive%team@historical.society, press%room@news-example.com).\n- Some have dots or hyphens in the local part (e.g., charlotte.h@north.town.news, lab-staff@marine.science.au).\n- One has a leading dot in the local part: .lead@odd.example.\n\n#### 2. What do the False examples have in common?\n\n- Some have malformed email addresses (e.g., double dots, trailing hyphens, underscores in the domain, missing TLD, IP addresses, etc.).\n- Some use \"at\" and \"dot\" instead of @ and . (e.g., name at company dot com).\n- Some have invalid characters or structures (e.g., keith@site.cömx, adr@127.0.0.1, root@-host-name.com).\n- Some have missing TLDs (e.g., ops@site.c).\n- Some have underscores in the domain (e.g., jane_doe@sub_domain.org, mark@sub_domain.com).\n- Some have trailing punctuation or invalid endings (e.g., joe@example.com_, team_leads@example.com-).\n\n#### 3. Does Option A fit?\n\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n\n- But some False examples have TLDs with digits (e.g., zz@yy.9k is False).\n- Some True examples have TLDs with only letters (e.g., .org, .net, .com, .biz, .cloud, .io, .au, .uk, .de, .news, .group, .foundation, .design, .museum, .london, .finance, .systems, .care, .page, .app).\n- The presence of digits in the TLD does not seem to be the deciding factor.\n\n#### 4. Does Option B fit?\n\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n\n- Since the True examples all have valid-looking email addresses (with some flexibility for local part and domain, but not allowing underscores in the domain, double dots, trailing hyphens, etc.), this fits.\n- The False examples are all invalid according to standard email address rules (e.g., no underscores in domain, no double dots, no trailing hyphens, no IP addresses, no missing TLD, etc.).\n\n#### 5. Conclusion\n\nOption B is the better fit, as the rule is about matching a valid email address according to a specific specification (which is not fully shown, but can be inferred from the examples).\n\nOption A is too broad and does not explain the False examples with digit TLDs.\n\n### Final answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options:\n\n**Option A:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nBut the \"email specification below\" is not given in the prompt, so we have to infer what it might be from the examples.\n\nLet's look at the True and False examples and see what patterns emerge.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze True Examples\n\n- All True examples contain an email address.\n- The email addresses:\n  - Have a local part (before the @) that can include letters, numbers, dots, underscores, plus, percent, and hyphens.\n  - Have a domain part (after the @) that consists of labels separated by dots.\n  - The domain labels do not start or end with a hyphen or dot.\n  - The top-level domain (TLD) can be more than two or three letters (e.g., .museum, .directory, .foundation, .today, .cloud, .brussels, .events, .group, .conference, .coffee, .alumni, .app, .io, .org, .gov, .au, .ie, .team, .company, .city, .lab.africa, .ny.gov, .localdomain, .toolsuite.cloud, .science.au, .page, .classes, .team.io, .theatre, .beta.company, .status.page, .shared.bike.city, .founders.lab.africa).\n  - The TLD never contains digits in the True examples.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze False Examples\n\n- False examples include:\n  - Emails with missing TLDs (e.g., alice@domain, admin@domain, user@domain).\n  - Emails with invalid TLDs (e.g., betty@site.c0m, t@1.2, name@example.12345, root@host.123).\n  - Emails with double dots (e.g., cc@site..org, dev@host..name.net, user@example..com).\n  - Emails with trailing or leading dots or hyphens in domain labels (e.g., bob@.example.com, quinn@node-.io, support@-broken.example).\n  - Emails with invalid characters (e.g., tim@exa_mple.co, end.@example.com_).\n  - Emails with extra punctuation at the end (e.g., [contact@example.org.], first.last@example.com., joe@example.com_).\n  - Emails with multiple @ (e.g., ro@@c.com).\n  - Emails with incomplete domain (e.g., user@example.c, ops@site.c).\n\n### Step 3: Compare to the Options\n\n- Option A says: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n  - But in the True examples, there are no TLDs with digits. In the False examples, emails with digits in the TLD (e.g., betty@site.c0m, root@host.123, name@example.12345) are marked False.\n  - So Option A is not correct.\n\n- Option B says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n  - Since the True examples all have valid email addresses (according to a strict specification), and the False examples violate common email rules, this fits.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, as the rule is about matching a valid email specification (with a valid TLD, no double dots, no invalid characters, etc.), not about allowing digits in the TLD.\n\n**Final answer:**\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Examples with digits in the TLD:\n- False: The note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd\n- False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n- True: The cafe's orders go to latte-art@north.pier.coffee\n- True: Please write to recruiter@talent.pool.jobs for referrals\n\nSo, emails with digits in the TLD (like c0m) are marked False, not True. This suggests that Option A is not correct, because if it were, those would be True.\n\n#### 2. Examples with valid email tokens:\n- True: Please write to recruiter@talent.pool.jobs for referrals\n- True: Please notify dave.oreilly@cork.arts.ie when you arrive\n- True: The editor's desk is editors@literary.review.magazine\n\nThese all have valid email addresses.\n\n#### 3. Examples with malformed emails:\n- False: He jotted kevin@site.cöm on the corner of the page (non-ASCII character in TLD)\n- False: Use 'first.last@example.com.' at most once (trailing dot)\n- False: Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage (double dot)\n- False: Try admin@mailserver1 for internal messages (no TLD)\n- False: The note had user@domain with no suffix (no TLD)\n- False: Please write to jane@example.com. when you can (trailing dot)\n\nThese are all marked False, and they all violate standard email rules.\n\n#### 4. The new example:\n- Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced\n\nThis was marked False. The TLD is \"abc123\" (contains digits), so again, Option A would have made this True, but it's False.\n\n#### 5. Option B:\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below (presumably a standard, valid email address).\n\nThis matches the pattern: all True examples have a valid email address, and all False examples have something wrong with the email (invalid TLD, malformed, etc).\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is correct, because the rule is about matching a valid email address according to standard specifications, not about allowing digits in the TLD.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

From the examples, we can infer the following about valid emails:\n- Must have a local part, an @, and a domain part.\n- The domain part must have at least one dot, and the top-level domain (TLD) must be at least two letters.\n- No underscores in the domain.\n- No consecutive dots.\n- No leading or trailing dots or hyphens in domain labels.\n- TLDs are alphabetic only (no digits or special characters).\n- No non-ASCII characters in the domain.\n- The email must not be immediately followed or preceded by invalid characters (like a trailing dash or underscore).\n\nNow, let's look at Option B: \"whose top-level domain may include digits.\" But in the negative examples, addresses like ops@site.9k and zz@yy.9k are marked False, indicating that TLDs with digits are not accepted. Also, root@host.123 is marked False. This means Option B cannot be correct.\n\nOption A is more general and matches the pattern: the string is accepted if it contains at least one token that matches the (implied) email specification.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

-gamma.net is invalid (hyphen at start)\n- The formula had email@example.c_m embedded\n  - c_m is not a valid TLD (underscore)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- In all True cases, the email address is valid and the TLD does not contain digits.\n- In False cases, emails with TLDs that contain digits (e.g., 9k, 9net, abc123, 123) are marked False.\n- In False cases, emails with invalid domain syntax (double dots, hyphens at start/end, underscores, etc.) are marked False.\n- In True cases, the TLD is always alphabetic and at least two characters.\n\n**Option B** says the string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose TLD may include digits. But in the examples, any TLD with digits is marked False.\n\n**Option A** says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification (which, from the examples, is a standard valid email address with a valid TLD, no digits in TLD, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A is correct, as the examples only accept standard valid email addresses, and reject those with TLDs containing digits or other invalid forms.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options:\n\n**Option A:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nLet's look at the examples and see which rule fits better.\n\n### Step 1: What is the \"email specification below\"?\nSince the specification is not given, but from the examples, it seems to be a stricter version of email validation than just \"email-like\" (e.g., no double dots, no trailing punctuation, no leading/trailing hyphens in domain parts, TLDs must be at least 2 letters, etc.).\n\n### Step 2: Do True examples ever have digits in the TLD?\nLet's check:\n- True: sales@artisan.bakery.london (TLD: london)\n- True: signups@cleanup.river.earth (TLD: earth)\n- True: hello@green.energy (TLD: energy)\n- True: calendar@team-suite.app (TLD: app)\n- True: sev1@status.page (TLD: page)\n- True: school_admin@winter-valley.edu (TLD: edu)\n- True: dns-admin@registry.internet (TLD: internet)\n- True: lab-staff@marine.science.au (TLD: au)\n- True: forms@digital.city.brussels (TLD: brussels)\n- True: beta@product.preview.site (TLD: site)\n- True: editors@literary.review.magazine (TLD: magazine)\n\nNone of these have digits in the TLD. Let's check False examples with digits in the TLD:\n- False: mail@domain.123 (TLD: 123)\n- False: zz@yy.9k (TLD: 9k)\n- False: luke@site.c0 (TLD: c0)\n\nAll of these are False. So, if the TLD contains digits, the example is False.\n\n### Step 3: Are there True examples with digits in the TLD?\nNo. All True examples have TLDs with only letters.\n\n### Step 4: Are there False examples with TLDs that are only letters?\nYes:\n- False: tiny@big.c (TLD: c, too short)\n- False: carol@site.c (TLD: c, too short)\n- False: name@example,com (comma instead of dot)\n- False: name@example.com- (trailing hyphen)\n- False: fiona@server-.net (hyphen at end of domain part)\n- False: pam@-sub.domain.org (hyphen at start of domain part)\n- False: team@-lead.org (hyphen at start of domain part)\n- False: dev@host (no TLD)\n- False: alice@domain (no TLD)\n- False: user@domain (no TLD)\n- False: mail@domain..org (double dot)\n- False: user@example..com (double dot)\n- False: bob@.example.com (dot at start of domain)\n- False: bob@.tld.com (dot at start of domain)\n- False: dev@-alpha.beta (hyphen at start of domain part)\n- False: joe@example.com_ (trailing underscore)\n- False: jane@example.com. (trailing period)\n- False: me@example.com. (trailing period)\n\n### Step 5: Are there True examples with TLDs that are only letters and otherwise valid?\nYes, all True examples fit this.\n\n### Step 6: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\nBut in the examples, if the TLD includes digits, it's always False. So Option A is not correct.\n\n### Step 7: Does Option B fit?\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\nGiven the examples, the True cases all have a valid email address (with a TLD of at least 2 letters, no leading/trailing hyphens or dots, no double dots, etc.), and the False cases violate these rules.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

But in the True examples, there are no TLDs with digits. In fact, the False examples include emails with TLDs containing digits, and those are rejected.\n\n**Option A** says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. The \"email specification\" is not fully spelled out, but from the examples, it seems to be a standard email address with a valid domain and TLD (alphabetic only, no digits, no trailing dot, no double dot, no label ending with dash, etc.).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption A is correct, because the True examples all have a valid email address according to a stricter specification (no digits in TLD, no malformed domains, etc.), and Option B is incorrect because TLDs with digits are always rejected.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

(dot after TLD)\n- michael@somewhere..co.jp (double dot)\n- user@example..com (double dot)\n- abc@example,org (comma instead of dot)\n- name@example.com- (hyphen after TLD)\n- user@sub..domain.com (double dot)\n- bob@.tld.com (dot at start of domain)\n- foo@bar.c0m (digit in TLD)\n- tiny@big.c (single letter TLD)\n- email@example.c_m (underscore in TLD)\n- dev@-alpha.beta (hyphen at start of domain)\n- support@-broken.example (hyphen at start of domain)\n- betty@site.c0m (digit in TLD)\n- t@1.2 (all digits in domain and TLD)\n\nFrom these, we can see that:\n\n- TLDs with digits (e.g., c0m, c0m) are rejected.\n- TLDs with underscores are rejected.\n- TLDs with non-ASCII characters are rejected.\n- TLDs with a single letter are rejected.\n- Double dots in the domain are rejected.\n- Domains starting with a dot or hyphen are rejected.\n- TLDs with trailing punctuation are rejected.\n\nNow, let's look at Option A: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n\nBut in the False examples, foo@bar.c0m and betty@site.c0m are both rejected, even though their TLDs include digits. So Option A cannot be correct.\n\nOption B: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n\nGiven that the True examples all have valid emails according to a stricter email specification (no digits in TLD, no double dots, no leading/trailing punctuation, etc.), and the False examples violate these rules, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

ro@@c.com while rushing\n- False: Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage\n\n### Key Observations\n\n- Many False examples are rejected for invalid email syntax: double dots, invalid TLDs, underscores in the domain, TLDs that are too short, TLDs with digits, etc.\n- True examples accept a wide variety of valid email addresses, including those with plus, percent, and hyphens in the local part, and multi-level domains.\n- False: \"We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\" is rejected, suggesting TLDs with digits are not allowed.\n- False: \"Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\" is rejected, again suggesting TLDs with only digits are not allowed.\n- False: \"He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\" is rejected, again TLD with digit.\n- True: \"You can reach me at ALEXANDRA@CLOUD.EXPERT for the quote\" is accepted, TLD is \"EXPERT\" (all letters).\n- True: \"boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk\" is accepted, TLD is \"uk\" (all letters).\n- False: \"The formula had email@example.c_m embedded\" is rejected, TLD has underscore.\n\n### Comparing the Options\n\n- **Option A** says the string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose TLD may include digits. But the examples show that TLDs with digits (e.g., .9k, .123, .c0, .qu0) are all rejected.\n- **Option B** says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. This is more general and fits the pattern: only valid email addresses (according to a certain specification) are accepted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct, because the examples show that only valid email addresses (with TLDs of at least two letters, no digits or underscores, no double dots, etc.) are accepted. Option A is contradicted by the data.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

True: RSVPs can go to donna.lee@alumni.ox.ac.uk by Friday\n    - TLD is \"uk\" (no digits)\n25. True: Address the package to shipping@warehouse.global and include the code\n    - TLD is \"global\" (no digits)\n26. True: For badges, contact badges@annual.conference\n    - TLD is \"conference\" (no digits)\n27. True: He answers messages at coach@mountain.bike on Tuesdays\n    - TLD is \"bike\" (no digits)\n28. True: Ping .lead@odd.example if the script fails\n    - TLD is \"example\" (no digits)\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. False: Someone typed end.@example.com+ by accident\n   - TLD is \"com\" (no digits), but the email is malformed (ends with a dot before the @)\n2. False: Spotted bob@.tld.com on a sticker\n   - The domain starts with a dot, which is invalid\n3. False: He jotted kevin@site.cöm on the corner of the page\n   - TLD is \"cöm\" (contains an umlaut, not a digit)\n4. False: Their note had foo@bar.c0m, which seemed odd\n   - TLD is \"c0m\" (contains a digit)\n5. False: The fake address was a@b.c which is not accepted\n   - TLD is \"c\" (too short)\n6. False: The note had carol@site.c, which is too short\n   - TLD is \"c\" (too short)\n7. False: The note had user@domain with no suffix\n   - No TLD\n8. False: Please don't post test@example.com.\n   - TLD is \"com\" (no digits), but the period at the end is outside the email, so this should be valid unless the period is considered part of the email.\n9. False: The banner had sales@site.-zone.com printed on it\n   - The domain has a label starting with a hyphen, which is invalid\n10. False: Use jane_doe@sub_domain.org only as a placeholder\n    - The domain has an underscore, which is invalid in domain names\n\nNow, let's check the new example:\n\nCurious minds can message wonder+kids@science.camp\n\n- The email is wonder+kids@science.camp\n- TLD is \"camp\" (no digits)\n- The local part contains a plus sign, which is valid in email addresses\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A says the TLD may include digits. But in the False examples, \"foo@bar.c0m\" (TLD \"c0m\") is marked False, even though the TLD has a digit. This suggests that Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. The True examples all have valid email addresses according to standard email rules (RFC 5322), and the False examples violate some aspect of the email specification (invalid characters, invalid TLD length, invalid domain label, etc.).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

So Option B does not fit, because these are not accepted.\n\n### Step 3: Are there any True examples with digits in the TLD?\nLooking at the True examples, none have digits in the TLD. All TLDs are alphabetic or punycode (xn--...).\n\n### Step 4: Are there True examples with valid email addresses?\nYes, all True examples contain a valid email address, sometimes with subdomains, plus addressing, or punycode, but always with a valid TLD (alphabetic or punycode).\n\n### Step 5: Are there False examples with invalid email addresses?\nYes, all False examples have something wrong with the email address: invalid TLD, double dots, underscores in the domain, digits-only TLD, etc.\n\n### Step 6: Does Option A fit all True and False examples?\nYes. Option A says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification (i.e., a valid email address). This matches the examples.\n\n### Step 7: Does Option B fit?\nNo. Option B would accept emails with digits in the TLD, but those are marked False.\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption A is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

So Option B cannot be correct, because the rule does NOT accept TLDs with digits.\n\n### Step 3: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\nGiven the True examples, all the accepted emails are valid according to standard email rules (with a valid TLD, no invalid characters, etc). The False examples violate these rules (e.g., invalid TLD, double dots, invalid characters, etc).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples, Option B does not.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

In the False examples, TLDs with digits are always False.\n- Option B says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n  - This is more general and would allow for a stricter, correct email specification (e.g., TLDs must be alphabetic, no double dots, no invalid characters, etc.).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is incorrect because TLDs with digits are always False in the examples. Option B is correct because the True examples always have a valid email address according to a stricter email specification.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

False: Note the typo: betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n2. False: He typed luke@site.c0, probably by accident\n3. False: The address alice@10.0.0.5 was on the whiteboard\n4. False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter\n\nIn all these False examples, the TLD contains digits (c0m, c0, 123, 0.0.0.5). These are marked False.\n\nNow, let's look at True examples:\n\n1. True: Please CC editors@review.board.org when you reply\n2. True: Please forward to grants@science-funding.org ASAP\n3. True: The form auto-sends to forms@digital.city.brussels\n4.

The TLD is \"c0m\" (contains a digit).\n\nTherefore, Option B (\"accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits\") cannot be correct, because the presence of digits in the TLD leads to a False label.\n\nOption A is more general and fits the pattern: the string is accepted when it contains a valid email address (with a TLD of only letters, as per standard email rules).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

betty@site.c0m, in the caption\n- Oddly, the sticker said path@server.company- near the margin\n- Note that admin@domain is incomplete\n- The document shows .lead@odd.example- near the margin\n- They typed too many ats in ro@@c.com while rushing\n- That slide showed adr@127.0.0.1 during the talk\n- Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver\n- A misprint read mail@example.c_m in the

once\n- The address alice@10.0.0.5 was on the whiteboard\n- They mentioned user@example.c in passing\n- We noticed someone put zz@yy.9k on the chart\n- The demo showed alpha@beta.-gamma.net on screen\n- Avoid using kevin@site.9net in examples\n\n### Step 2: What is the difference?\n\n#### Option A: Accepts TLDs with digits\n- But \"kevin@site.c0m\" is False (TLD has a digit, but it's not accepted)\n- \"zz@yy.9k\" is False (TLD is \"9k\", not accepted)\n- \"kevin@site.9net\" is False (TLD is \"9net\", not accepted)\n- \"alerts+night@ops.team.io\" is True (TLD is \"io\", no digits)\n- \"boxoffice@theatre-company.co.uk\" is True (TLD is \"uk\", no digits)\n- \"forms@digital.city.brussels\" is True (TLD is \"brussels\", no digits)\n- \"anna@xn--bcher-kva.de\" is True (TLD is \"de\", no digits)\n- \"press@cityhall.ny.gov\" is True (TLD is \"gov\", no digits)\n- \"dns-admin@registry.internet\" is True (TLD is \"internet\", no digits)\n\nSo, Option A is not supported by the data: TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n#### Option B: At least one token matches the email specification\n\nLooking at the False examples, many are invalid emails:\n- Double dots in domain (\"user@example..co.uk\")\n- Underscore in domain (\"mark@sub_domain.com\")\n- TLD too short (\"user@example.c\")\n- TLD with digits (\"kevin@site.c0m\")\n- TLD with invalid character (\"mail@example.c_m\")\n- Domain ends with hyphen (\"team_leads@example.com-\")\n- Domain starts with hyphen (\"team@-lead.org\")\n- Domain ends with hyphen (\"path@server.company-\")\n- IP address as domain (\"adr@127.0.0.1\")\n- Incomplete domain (\"admin@domain\")\n- Extra punctuation at end (\"abc@def.com_\")\n- Double @ (\"ro@@c.com\")\n- TLD with digit (\"zz@yy.9k\")\n- TLD with digit (\"kevin@site.9net\")\n- TLD with digit (\"alpha@beta.-gamma.net\")\n- TLD with digit (\"tiny@big.c\")\n- TLD with digit (\"user@example.c0m\")\n\nThe True examples all have valid email addresses according to standard email rules (RFC 5322, with some leniency for plus, percent, and hyphens in local/domain).\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nOption B is correct: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the standard email specification (no underscores in domain, no digits in TLD, no double dots, no trailing punctuation, etc).\n\nOption A is incorrect: TLDs with digits are not accepted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Otherwise, it's not (False).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n- This means: The string is accepted if it contains an email-like token, and the TLD (top-level domain) can have digits.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples and see which rule fits.\n\n### Step 1: What is the \"email specification\" in Option A?\nFrom the examples, the valid emails:\n- Have a local part (can include dots, plus, percent, underscores, etc.)\n- Have an @ symbol\n- Have a domain part (can include hyphens, dots, etc.)\n- The domain part is not allowed to start or end with a hyphen or dot.\n- The TLD (final part after the last dot) is at least two characters, all letters (e.g., .com, .org, .biz, .center, .group, .io, .ke, .brussels, .photos, .africa, .foundation, .union, .systems, .gov, .au, .uk, .ie, etc.)\n- No underscores in the domain part.\n- No double dots in the domain.\n- No trailing punctuation (like a period or underscore) after the email.\n- No malformed emails (e.g., double @, missing TLD, etc.)\n\n### Step 2: Does Option B fit?\nOption B says: \"email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n- But in the examples, there are no True examples with digits in the TLD. All TLDs are alphabetic (e.g., .com, .org, .biz, .center, .group, .io, .ke, .brussels, .photos, .africa, .foundation, .union, .systems, .gov, .au, .uk, .ie).\n- There are no examples like user@domain.123 or user@domain.c0m marked as True.\n- So, Option B does not fit the pattern of the True examples.\n\n### Step 3: Does Option A fit?\nOption A says: \"contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n- All True examples contain a valid email address, according to the standard specification (with the constraints above).\n- All False examples either have malformed emails, missing TLDs, invalid characters, double dots, trailing punctuation, or other issues.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nOption A fits the examples. Option B does not fit, because the True examples do not have digits in the TLD, and the rule is not about allowing digits in the TLD.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the two options and the examples step by step.\n\n**Option A:** The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\n**Option B:** The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nLet's break down what the examples show:\n\n### 1. What is the \"email specification\"?\nFrom the True examples, the accepted tokens look like standard email addresses:\n- They have a local part, an @, a domain, and a top-level domain (TLD).\n- The TLD is alphabetic (e.g., .com, .org, .biz, .museum, .gov, .camp, .life, .design, .dev, .portal, .university, .conference, .alumni, .board, .foundation, .global, etc.)\n- The domain and local part can have hyphens, underscores, plus, percent, and digits, but not consecutive dots, not starting/ending with hyphens or dots, and not malformed.\n\n### 2. What about TLDs with digits?\n- False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\n- False: Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced\n\nThese are marked False, so TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n\n### 3. What about \"at\" and \"dot\" instead of @ and .?\n- False: He prefers using words like at and dot instead of a@b.c\n- False: We use the format name at company dot com for inquiries\n\nThese are marked False, so only real email tokens are accepted.\n\n### 4. What about malformed emails?\n- False: There was an entry for user@sub..domain.com somewhere (consecutive dots)\n- False: The docs mention team@-lead.org somewhere (domain starts with hyphen)\n- False: The banner had sales@site.-zone.com printed on it (subdomain starts with hyphen)\n- False: We saw xyz@bad-.co.uk on the slide (subdomain ends with hyphen)\n- False: It mistakenly showed abc@.bad.tld in the draft (subdomain starts with dot)\n- False: The memo cited jane@example.c which isn't valid (TLD too short)\n- False: He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed (TLD too short)\n- False: He jotted kevin@site.cöm on the corner of the page (non-ASCII character in TLD)\n- False: Please write to jane@example.com. when you can (trailing dot)\n- False: Our example was user@example..co.uk which won't deliver (consecutive dots)\n- False: Please contact sara@domain..com about the outage (consecutive dots)\n\nAll these are False, so the rule is strict about email format.\n\n### 5. What about TLDs with digits?\n- False: Discussion moved to mail@domain.123 eventually\n- False: Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced\n\nAgain, these are False, so TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n\n### 6. What about Option B?\nOption B says: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\nBut the examples with digits in the TLD are marked False, so Option B is not correct.\n\n### 7. What about Option A?\nOption A says: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\nThis matches the pattern: only valid, standard email addresses are accepted.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

For example, \".capital\", \".healthcare\", \".app\", \".london\", \".ke\", \".foundation\", \".festival\", \".alumni\", \".coffee\", \".site\", \".org\", \".io\", \".au\", \".magazine\", \".localdomain\", \".company\", \".life\", \".biz\", \".io\", \".zone\", \".uk\", \".community\", \".page\", \".today\", \".union\", \".net\", \".bike\", \".uk\", \".collective\", \".center\", \".village\", \".classes\" — all are alphabetic.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see if any are rejected solely because of digits in the TLD:\n- He typed root@host.123 and hit enter (False)\n- Someone tried roger@host.abc123 but it bounced (False)\n- He wrote luke@site.c0, probably by accident (False)\n- The address alice@10.0.0.5 was on the whiteboard (False)\n- The demo showed alpha@beta.-gamma.net on screen (False)\n- Try name@[2001:db8::1] if the system asks (False)\n\nSo, some are rejected because the TLD is numeric or contains digits, but also other reasons (invalid format, IP address, etc).\n\nBut, crucially, the True examples never have digits in the TLD, so Option A (\"whose top-level domain may include digits\") is not supported by the True examples.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nGiven that the True examples all look like valid emails (with a valid local part, an @, a domain, and a TLD of at least two letters, no double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens, etc), and the False examples violate these rules, Option B is more likely.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

So Option B, which is about TLDs with digits, does not seem to be the distinguishing factor.\n\n### Step 2: Check for standard email specification\n\nNow, let's see if the True examples all match a standard email specification (with some flexibility for new TLDs, subdomains, plus addressing, etc.), and if the False examples violate standard email rules.\n\nSome False examples:\n- False: The whiteboard had fiona@server-.net scrawled on it (hyphen at end of domain label, invalid)\n- False: He wrote tiny@big.c and laughed (TLD too short, only one letter)\n- False: You might see abc@example,org in older docs (comma instead of dot)\n- False: I noticed y@x.z with a one-letter suffix (TLD too short)\n- False: Send a note to bob@.example.com after the meeting (dot at start of domain, invalid)\n- False: Try admin@mailserver1 for internal messages (no TLD)\n- False: Please send to dev@-alpha.beta immediately (hyphen at start of domain label, invalid)\n- False: Try name@[2001:db8::1] if the system asks (IP literal, not standard)\n- False: The tip mentioned bob@example..net in parentheses (double dot, invalid)\n- False: Her handle was mark@sub_domain.com in the draft (underscore in domain, invalid)\n- False: We saw xyz@bad-.co.uk on the slide (hyphen at end of label, invalid)\n- False: We saw abc@def.com_ on a sticker (underscore at end, invalid)\n- False: Please write to jane@example.com. when you can (dot at end, invalid)\n- False: Note that admin@domain is incomplete (no TLD)\n- False: The note had carol@site.c, which is too short (TLD too short)\n- False: Her notes included joe@example.com_ at the end (underscore at end, invalid)\n- False: Just type name@example,com in the browser (comma instead of dot)\n- False: Use jane_doe@sub_domain.org only as a placeholder (underscore in domain, invalid)\n\nAll of these are invalid according to standard email rules.\n\n### Step 3: Check the new example\n\n- He prefers CAPITALS@LOUD.DOMAIN.COM for emphasis\n\nThis is a valid email address (case-insensitive, but capitals are allowed), and the model classified it as True.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nOption A is the correct rule: the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the standard email specification (with support for modern TLDs, subdomains, plus addressing, etc.).\n\nOption B is not supported by the data, as none of the True examples have digits in the TLD.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

What is the \"email specification below\"?\nFrom the examples, it seems to be a standard email address, but with some flexibility for things like plus signs, percent signs, and subdomains.

What is the \"email specification below\" in Option A?\nFrom the examples, the accepted emails:\n- Have a local part (before the @) that can include dots, plus, underscores, and hyphens.\n- The domain part (after the @) can have multiple subdomains separated by dots.\n- The top-level domain (TLD) is always alphabetic and at least two characters (e.g., .com, .org, .africa, .brussels, .co.ke, .ox.ac.uk, .gov, .today, .chain, etc.).\n- No double dots, no leading/trailing dots or hyphens in domain labels, no underscores in domain, no non-ASCII characters, no numeric-only TLDs, no one-letter TLDs.\n\n### 2. What does Option B mean?\nOption B says the string is accepted if it contains an email-like token whose TLD may include digits.\n\nBut in the examples:\n- False: He typed root@host.123 and hit enter (TLD is numeric, and it's marked False)\n- True: Our CTO uses nikhil.patel@founders.lab.africa for mentoring (TLD is alphabetic, marked True)\n- True: The form auto-sends to forms@digital.city.brussels (TLD is alphabetic, marked True)\n- False: Ping x@y.z while testing (TLD is one letter, marked False)\n- False: The note had user@domain with no suffix (no TLD, marked False)\n\nSo, in all True cases, the TLD is alphabetic and at least two characters. Numeric TLDs are not accepted.\n\n### 3. Are there any True examples with digits in the TLD?\nNo. All True examples have alphabetic TLDs.\n\n### 4. Are there any False examples with alphabetic TLDs?\nYes, but only when the email is malformed in other ways (e.g., double dots, trailing hyphens, underscores in domain, etc.).\n\n### 5. Does Option A fit all True/False examples?\nYes. The True examples all have a valid email address according to standard email rules (RFC-like), and the False examples violate those rules.\n\n### 6. Does Option B fit all True/False examples?\nNo. Option B would allow numeric TLDs, but those are marked False in the examples.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption A is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

underscores, hyphens at start/end, non-ASCII, etc).\n- Option A says TLD may include digits, but the examples show that TLDs with digits are always marked False.\n- Option B refers to a specific email specification (not shown here, but the pattern is that only valid emails with all-letter TLDs are accepted).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption B is correct, as the rule is about matching a valid email address with a TLD of at least two letters, all alphabetic, and no digits or invalid characters.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Many False examples are rejected because of invalid domain or TLD:\n   - TLD too short (e.g., .c)\n   - TLD with digits (e.g., .9k, .123, .qu0)\n   - TLD with invalid characters (e.g., .xn--, .-zone.com)\n   - Double dots (e.g., ..com, ..org)\n   - Domain starts or ends with a hyphen (e.g., server-.net, -broken.example)\n   - Domain or TLD missing (e.g., admin@host, user@domain)\n   - Local part or domain with invalid characters (e.g., exa_mple, .com_)\n\n2. True examples always have:\n   - A valid local part (letters, digits, dots, hyphens, underscores, plus)\n   - An @ symbol\n   - A domain with at least one dot, and each label is at least 2 characters (except possibly the last label, but in practice, all TLDs are at least 2 characters)\n   - TLDs are alphabetic only (no digits)\n   - No double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens in domain labels\n\nNow, let's check Option A: \"The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\"\n\nBut in the False examples, addresses like root@host.123 and zz@yy.9k are rejected, even though their TLDs include digits. This suggests that TLDs with digits are NOT accepted.\n\nOption B: \"The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\"\n\nGiven that the True examples all match a stricter email specification (valid local part, valid domain, valid TLD with only letters, no double dots, no leading/trailing hyphens, etc.), and the False examples violate these rules, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "followup_prompt": "Choose which rule explains the examples. One of the rules is correct and the other is incorrect. You must pick one of the rules.\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"answer\":\"A\"} or {\"answer\":\"B\"}, but make sure to think step-by-step first and show all of your reasoning.",
      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an email-like token whose top-level domain may include digits.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- All True examples contain a valid-looking email address, e.g., \"support_team@cityservices.gov\", \"jasper.may+field@northshore.ai\", \"donna.lee@alumni.ox.ac.uk\", etc.\n- The email addresses have:\n  - A local part (before the @) that can include dots, underscores, hyphens, and plus signs.\n  - A domain part (after the @) that can include subdomains separated by dots.\n  - The top-level domain (TLD) is always at least two letters, e.g., \".gov\", \".ai\", \".uk\", \".io\", \".ke\", \".us\", \".africa\", \".systems\", \".directory\", \".community\", \".center\", \".club\", \".foundation\", \".city\", \".biz\", \".collective\", \".training\", \".hub\", \".lab\", \".healthcare\", \".arts\", \".page\", \".app\", \".jobs\", \".team\", \".life\", \".festival\".\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- False examples include:\n  - Invalid TLDs: \"jane@example.c\", \"a@b.c\", \"name@example.12345\"\n  - Invalid characters: \"someone@exa_mple.co.uk\", \"jane_doe@sub_domain.org\", \"mark@sub_domain.com\", \"mail@example.c_m\"\n  - Double dots: \"user@example..com\", \"user@sub..domain.com\", \"bruce@fake..domain.org\"\n  - Trailing or leading hyphens: \"name@subdomain-\", \"name@-dash-.com\", \"xyz@bad-.co.uk\", \"support@-broken.example\"\n  - Trailing punctuation: \"test@example.com.\", \"team_leads@example.com-\"\n  - Non-ASCII: \"alan@server.cöm\"\n  - IP address: \"adr@127.0.0.1\"\n  - No TLD: \"user@domain\"\n  - No @: \"dev@host\"\n  - Obfuscated: \"name[at]company[dot]org\"\n  - One-letter TLD: \"a@b.c\"\n  - TLD with underscore: \"mail@example.c_m\"\n\nNow, let's compare the options:\n\nOption A says the only requirement is an email-like token, and the TLD may include digits. But in the False examples, \"name@example.12345\" is marked False, even though the TLD is all digits. This suggests that allowing digits in the TLD is not sufficient for acceptance.\n\nOption B says the string is accepted when it contains at least one token that matches the email specification below. The details of the \"email specification\" are not given here, but from the examples, it is clear that the rule is stricter than just \"email-like\" and that certain invalid forms are rejected.\n\nGiven that Option A would accept \"name@example.12345\" (since it allows digits in the TLD), but this is marked False, Option A cannot be correct.\n\nOption B is more general and matches the pattern of the examples: only valid, well-formed email addresses are accepted, and invalid ones are not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",
