(2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better? (1 question mark, but also another question, so 2 implied)\n- Is anyone home? Hello?

(no question mark, 1 exclamation)\n- That joke was hilarious! (no question mark, 1 exclamation)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test Option A:\n- True examples: All have no exclamation marks and at most one question mark (all have exactly one).\n- False examples: If there are two question marks (even if no exclamation), it's False. If there is any exclamation, it's False. If there are zero question marks and no exclamation, let's check: \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (False, 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks). So Option A would incorrectly accept this as True, but it's marked False.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n- True examples: All have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- False examples: If there are two question marks, it's False. If there are zero question marks, it's False. If there is any exclamation, it's False.\n\nSo Option B fits all the data: only sentences with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are True.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the options and the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the True and False examples and see which rule fits better.\n\n### Step 1: Exclamation Marks\n\nAll True examples have no exclamation marks. All False examples with exclamation marks are False. So both rules require no exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 2: Number of Question Marks\n\nLet's look at some True examples:\n\n- \"Is anyone using the conference room now?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the hike suitable for beginners?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will your presentation include a demo?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have they posted the results online?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did the package arrive this morning?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this seat taken by anyone?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will we need umbrellas this afternoon?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did the landlord respond to your email?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are the meeting notes in the shared folder?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would you mind closing the window?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this address correct for the courier?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you checked the flight status?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this the line for tickets?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can you read that sign from here?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have they announced the winners yet?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do we need to print the tickets in advance?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you seen my keys anywhere?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I save my progress without logging in?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I return this item without a receipt?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the restaurant taking reservations today?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you booked the venue for June?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the printer out of ink again?\" (1 question mark)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples with more than one question mark:\n\n- \"Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is the file saved? Can I shut down?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks) — False\n\nSo, more than one question mark is always False.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any True examples with zero question marks.\n\nLooking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark.\n\n### Step 3: At Most One vs. Exactly One\n\nOption A allows for zero or one question mark. Option B requires exactly one.\n\nAre there any True examples with zero question marks? Let's check:\n\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nAre there any False examples with zero question marks? Yes, many:\n\n- \"Please send the report by Friday.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"I love this song!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"Leave the parcel with the neighbor if I'm out.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"This is amazing!!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Turn left at the second traffic light.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"She left a note on the table.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"Add garlic and stir for three minutes.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The cake turned out perfectly!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"You were right all along!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"It was quieter after the power outage.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"So many people showed up!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"Don't forget your jacket!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"Close the window right now!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"That was the best meal I've had all year!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n\nSo, zero question marks is always False.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples have either zero or more than one question mark, or have exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, but also a statement after, False)\n\nBut actually, these have more than one sentence, but only one question mark. However, the second sentence is not a question, so perhaps the rule is about the number of question marks, not sentences.\n\nBut in all True examples, there is exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 6: Test the new text\n\n\"Leave the parcel with the neighbor if I'm out.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — classified as False.\n\nSo, Option B would allow this (since at most one question mark), but it's False.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption A is correct: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it would allow zero question marks, but all such examples are False.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Do we need milk?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects (more than one question mark), B rejects (not exactly one question mark).\n\n3. \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects, B rejects.\n\n4. \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects, B rejects.\n\n5. \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects, B rejects.\n\n6. \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects, B rejects.\n\n7. \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A rejects, B rejects.\n\nNow, let's look for edge cases:\n\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\"  \n  - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Both A and B accept.\n\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\"  \n  - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A accepts (at most one question mark), B rejects (not exactly one question mark).  \n  - But in the previous answer, this was classified as False, so A would have accepted, but the correct answer was False. This suggests A is not correct.\n\n- \"The dog slept through the storm.\"  \n  - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A accepts, B rejects. But this was marked False, so A is not correct.\n\n- \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\"  \n  - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → Both A and B reject.\n\n- \"Are you free to talk after the meeting?\"  \n  - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Both A and B accept.\n\n- \"Have you met the new neighbor yet?\"  \n  - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Both A and B accept.\n\n- \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\"  \n  - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Both A and B accept.\n\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\"  \n  - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → A accepts, B rejects. But this was marked False, so A is not correct.\n\nSo, the key is that sentences with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks are marked False, which means Option A is not correct, because A would accept those.\n\nOption B only accepts sentences with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches all the True examples and rejects all the False ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Should I add ice?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n- \"Is the file saved? Can I shut down?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n- \"Is there a discount today?

Did they leave a slip?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n\nAlso, some False examples have exclamation marks, but that's not relevant for distinguishing A vs B, since both require 0 exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B: Accepts strings with no exclamation marks and at most one question mark (so 0 or 1 question mark).\n\nBut in the True examples, there are several with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks, e.g.:\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (True)\n- \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (True)\n- \"Could you remind me of the deadline?\" (True)\n- \"Could I get a receipt for this purchase?\" (True)\n- \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (True)\n- \"Could you check the door before we leave?\" (True)\n- \"Would you mind closing the window?\" (True)\n\nSo, Option A would not accept these (since they have 0 question marks), but Option B would (since it allows at most one question mark, including 0).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nJSON answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Do you want to split the bill? (True)\n- One question mark, no exclamation mark. Both A and B accept.\n\n2. Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (False)\n- Two question marks, no exclamation mark.

This is amazing!! (False)\n- No question mark, has exclamation marks. Both A and B reject.\n\n8. The lights were left on overnight. (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. A accepts (since at most one question mark, no exclamation), B rejects (since not exactly one question mark).\n\nBut this is marked False, so A would incorrectly accept this, but B would correctly reject.\n\nHowever, let's check more:\n\n9.

Let's look at some True examples:\n   - \"Is the theater accessible by tram?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Do we have enough chairs for everyone?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n\n2.

Are you sure?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Is that thunder?

Now, let's test the rules:\n\nOption A: Only accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (0 question marks) → True in the data, but would be False under Option A.\n- \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (0 question marks) → True in the data, but would be False under Option A.\n\nOption B: Accepts strings with no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → True under Option B.\n- \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → True under Option B.\n- \"Is the theater accessible by tram?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True under Option B.\n- \"Do we have bread?

(OK)\n- False examples: \n    - \"Add garlic and stir for three minutes.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False. So Option A would incorrectly accept this.\n    - \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"The lights were left on overnight.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"The password was changed yesterday.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"Please lock the door on your way out.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n    - \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" (no exclamation, no question mark) → Should be accepted by Option A, but is False.\n\nSo Option A would incorrectly accept many False examples.\n\nNow, Option B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\n- True examples: All have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. (OK)\n- False examples:\n    - \"Add garlic and stir for three minutes.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct (should be False).\n    - \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"The lights were left on overnight.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"The password was changed yesterday.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"Please lock the door on your way out.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → Not accepted by Option B, which is correct.\n    - All other False examples either have exclamation marks or more than one question mark, so Option B would not accept them, which is correct.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

True: \"Did you see the email about the schedule?\"  \n   - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Accepted by both A and B.\n\n2. False: \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → Not accepted by A (needs exactly 1), not accepted by B (at most 1).\n\n3. False: \"We won the match!\"  \n   - 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark → Not accepted by either (exclamation mark present).\n\n4. False: \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\"  \n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → Not accepted by either.\n\n5. True: \"Will you send the report by Friday?\"  \n   - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Accepted by both.\n\n6. False: \"My phone battery died before the call.\"  \n   - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → Not accepted by A (needs exactly 1), accepted by B (at most 1, but let's check if this is a problem).\n\nWait: This is a key point. According to Option B, a string with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks should be accepted. But in the examples, such strings are marked False. For example:\n\n- False: \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks)\n- False: \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks)\n- False: \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks)\n\nSo, Option B would incorrectly accept these, but the examples mark them as False.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, only accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. Let's check if any True examples have 0 question marks:\n\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's check if any True examples have more than one question mark:\n\n- No, all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nLet's check if any True examples have 0 question marks:\n\n- No, all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nTherefore, Option A fits the data: only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted.\n\nOption B would accept strings with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks, but those are marked False in the examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Incredible!\")\n\nNow, let's test the two options:\n\n**Option A: Exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks**\n- All True examples fit this.\n- All False examples violate this (either 0 or >1 question marks, or at least one exclamation mark).\n\n**Option B: No exclamation marks and at most one question mark**\n- This would allow 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks, but there are False examples with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks (e.g., \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\"). So this rule would incorrectly classify some False examples as True.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

All False examples with exclamation marks are False. So both rules require no exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 2: Number of Question Marks\n\nLet's look at the True examples:\n\n- \"Have you tried the new bakery on Pine Street?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will there be vegetarian options at dinner?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there parking behind the museum?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the hike suitable for beginners?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could you remind me of the deadline?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are these seats reserved for guests?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are you free to talk after the meeting?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would you mind closing the window?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the package insured during shipping?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this seat taken by anyone?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do we need a permit to film here?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the Wi-Fi password written somewhere?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can we share a taxi to the airport?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do we need to print the tickets in advance?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this the correct platform for the train?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would an earlier flight be possible?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you mind if I open a window?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did your phone update overnight?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the guest list final now?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the theater accessible by tram?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we still going hiking this weekend?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would tomorrow work better for you?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (1 question mark)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples with more than one question mark:\n\n- \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Are we there yet? Are we close?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (2 question marks) — False\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (2 question marks) — False\n\nAll of these are False.\n\nNow, let's look at False examples with zero question marks:\n\n- \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The bakery opens at seven tomorrow.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"There is a note on your desk.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"I can't believe it's raining again!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"The dog slept through the storm.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"The museum closes early on Mondays.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"She plays the piano every evening.\" (0 question marks) — False\n- \"This plan works perfectly!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"We finally finished the project!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"That sunset looks incredible!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"That joke was hilarious!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"I love this song!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"Stop right there!\" (0 question marks, but has exclamation mark) — False\n- \"You lost your passport?!\" (1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark) — False\n\nSo, all False examples have either 0 or more than 1 question mark, or have exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 3: At Most One vs. Exactly One\n\nOption A allows 0 or 1 question mark, Option B allows exactly 1.\n\nBut in the examples, all True cases have exactly 1 question mark. There are no True cases with 0 question marks.\n\n### Step 4: The New Example\n\n\"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Classified as False.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the options step by step:\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n- Many True examples have one question mark and no exclamation marks. For example: \"Is the printer out of ink again?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks)\n- Some True examples have more than one question mark? Let's check: \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (1 question mark), \"Are tables available outside right now?\" (1 question mark), \"Could I ask a quick question about the form?\" (1 question mark), etc.\n- None of the True examples have more than one question mark.\n- None of the True examples have exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n- \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) — False (wait, this one has only one question mark, but is False)\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n\nSo, it seems that if there are two or more question marks, it's always False.\n\nBut \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" is False, even though it has only one question mark and no exclamation marks. Let's look at that one. The second sentence is \"Or is it theirs?\" — that's a question, but it's a fragment, and the whole text is two questions, but only one question mark. But the rule is about question marks, not questions.\n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- This would mean: 0 or 1 question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- This would mean: exactly 1 question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's check if any True example has 0 question marks:\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I get a receipt for this purchase?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will your presentation include a demo?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did you finish reading the last chapter?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this address correct for the courier?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could you check the door before we leave?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you remember the shortcut through the park?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did you lock the back door?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do they offer student discounts here?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this the correct platform for the train?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I ask a quick question about the form?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could we try a different approach next time?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the printer out of ink again?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are tables available outside right now?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I get directions to the gallery?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the lake safe for swimming today?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the car ready for pickup?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is your laptop compatible with the projector?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will the cafe be open on Sunday?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are these seats reserved for guests?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are pets allowed in this building?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did you manage to fix the printer jam?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will there be snacks at the workshop?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"May I borrow your charger for a moment?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you need help carrying those boxes?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will you send the report by Friday?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you seen my keys anywhere?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (1 question mark)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nAre there any True examples with 0 question marks? No.\n\nTherefore, Option A would incorrectly accept sentences with 0 question marks, but all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

This would violate Option B.\n\nNow, Option A (no exclamation marks, at most one question mark):\n\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (no question mark, no exclamation) → True\n- \"Is this address correct for the courier?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n- \"Do we have bread? Do we need milk?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n\nSo, Option A fits: True if no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check for exclamation marks:\n- \"Unbelievable performance!\" (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- \"This plan works perfectly!\" (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n\nSo, Option A fits all the examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Let's look at some True examples:\n   - \"Have you met the new neighbor yet?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Do you want to split the bill?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Would tomorrow work better for you?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n\n2. Let's look at some False examples:\n   - \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n3. Let's check for exclamation marks:\n   - \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"We won the match!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n\n4. Let's check for 0 question marks:\n   - \"There is a note on your desk.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"The dog slept through the storm.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n5. Let's check for 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All True examples fit this.\n\n6. Let's check for 0 or 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - But \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"There is a note on your desk.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\nSo, Option B would allow 0 or 1 question mark, but some examples with 0 question marks are False. Therefore, Option B is too broad.\n\nOption A requires exactly 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks. All True examples fit this, and all False examples violate it (either 0 or more than 1 question mark, or any exclamation mark).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

There are none.\nAre there any True examples with more than 1 question mark? No.\n\nAre there any False examples with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks? Yes:\n- \"The museum closes early on Mondays.\"\n- \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\"\n- \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\"\n- \"The password was changed yesterday.\"\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\"\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\"\n- \"The cake turned out perfectly!\"\n- \"The sunset looks incredible!\"\n- \"Look at that view!\"\n- \"She left a note on the table.\"\n- \"Bring a sweater because it gets chilly.\"\n- \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\"\n- \"It was quieter after the power outage.\"\n- \"Congratulations on your promotion!\"\n- \"Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday.\"\n- \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\"\n- \"Please, just listen to me!\"\n\nBut many of these have exclamation marks, but some do not.

Did it help?\n- He left his umbrella on the train.\n- Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\n- Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\n- We finally finished the project!\n- Are we late? Did the movie already start?\n- The printer jammed again during the rush.\n- How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\n- Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\n- Look at that view!\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test these options:\n\n1. Do any True examples have more than one question mark? No, all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n2. Do any True examples have exclamation marks? No.\n3. Do any False examples have no exclamation marks and at most one question mark? Let's check:\n   - The lanterns lit the path to the gate. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - The meeting starts at nine sharp. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - We camped by the lake last summer. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - The elevator is out of service today. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - Dinner is ready in ten minutes. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - The lights were left on overnight. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - The dog slept through the storm. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - You did a fantastic job! (exclamation mark) → False\n   - Turn left at the second traffic light. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - The password was changed yesterday. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - We watched the clouds roll over the hills. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - Please, not again! (exclamation mark) → False\n   - I can't believe it's raining again! (exclamation mark) → False\n   - Close the window right now! (exclamation mark) → False\n   - He left his umbrella on the train. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - We finally finished the project! (exclamation mark) → False\n   - The printer jammed again during the rush. (no exclamation, no question mark) → False\n   - Look at that view! (exclamation mark) → False\n\nSo, Option A would accept all of these False examples, but they are marked False. This suggests Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's check if any True examples do not have exactly one question mark. All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's check if any False examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. Let's look for such examples:\n\n- The lanterns lit the path to the gate. (no question mark)\n- The meeting starts at nine sharp. (no question mark)\n- The elevator is out of service today. (no question mark)\n- The lights were left on overnight. (no question mark)\n- The dog slept through the storm. (no question mark)\n- Turn left at the second traffic light. (no question mark)\n- The password was changed yesterday. (no question mark)\n- We watched the clouds roll over the hills. (no question mark)\n- He left his umbrella on the train. (no question mark)\n- The printer jammed again during the rush. (no question mark)\n\nNone of these have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check for False examples with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks:\n\n- Is this your coat? Or is it theirs? (one question mark, but also \"Or is it theirs?\" is a second question, so two questions, but only one question mark. But the rule is about punctuation, not semantics.)\n- Are we late? Did the movie already start? (two question marks)\n- Did you save the document? Did you close the app? (two question marks)\n- Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare? (two question marks)\n- Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet? (two question marks)\n- Have you tried this method? Did it help? (two question marks)\n- Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip? (two question marks)\n- Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car? (two question marks)\n- Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (two question marks)\n- Is there a discount today? Is it stackable? (two question marks)\n- Can you hear me? Can you see the screen? (two question marks)\n- What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now. (two question marks)\n- How long will it take? Will traffic be bad? (two question marks)\n\nSo, all False examples with question marks have more than one question mark, or have exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, Option B fits all the data: True if and only if there is exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Or would two be better?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False\n- \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False\n- \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False\n- \"Is there a discount today?

Are you tired?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False\n\nAlso, any sentence with an exclamation mark is False, regardless of question marks.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts strings with no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\nOption B: Accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's check if any True example has zero question marks. If so, Option B would be wrong.\n\nLooking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check if any False example has zero question marks and no exclamation marks. For example:\n\n- \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"You did a fantastic job!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"It's so good to hear from you!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"Please, not again!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Happy birthday to you!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"We need to leave by eight.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"The lights were left on overnight.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Please lock the door on your way out.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Don't forget your jacket!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"That was intense!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"The answer is obvious!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n- \"It was quieter after the power outage.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Watch out for the step!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n\nSo, all sentences with 0 question marks are False.\n\nNow, let's check if any True example has more than one question mark. None do.\n\nSo, both Option A and Option B would classify the True examples as True.\n\nNow, let's check the difference: Option A would accept sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks, but in the data, all such sentences are False.\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

There are many True examples with exactly one question mark:\n   - \"Are you interested in joining our study group?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is there a quieter room we can use?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is your laptop compatible with the projector?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the blue folder on your desk?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Do you have time for a quick call?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is anyone using the conference room now?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Did your phone update overnight?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Are the tickets refundable if plans change?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Are these seats reserved for guests?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Should I bring a jacket for the evening?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Did the landlord respond to your email?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the library card still valid?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the hike suitable for beginners?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Do you mind if I open a window?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Did you lock the back door?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Could you check the door before we leave?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the lake safe for swimming today?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is this the line for tickets?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Will the cafe be open on Sunday?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Can we move the appointment to 3 pm?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Do you remember the shortcut through the park?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Did you see the email about the schedule?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the museum open late on Thursdays?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Have you tried the new bakery on Pine Street?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Could you remind me of the deadline?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is the restaurant taking reservations today?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Is this fabric machine washable?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"May we switch seats so I can sit by the window?\" (True, 1 ?)\n   - \"Will there be vegetarian options at dinner?\" (True, 1 ?)\n\n2. Are there any True examples with zero question marks?\n   - Let's check: All True examples seem to have exactly one question mark.\n\n3. Are there any True examples with more than one question mark?\n   - Let's check: All True examples have only one question mark.\n\n4. Are there any True examples with exclamation marks?\n   - Let's check: All True examples have no exclamation marks.\n\n5. Now, let's look at False examples:\n   - \"Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" (False, 2 ?)\n   - \"Please, not again!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"I can't believe it's raining again!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"Unbelievable performance!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"You did a fantastic job!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"Close the window right now!\" (False, 1 !)\n   - \"The answer is obvious!\" (False, 1 !)\n\n   Also, some False examples have zero question marks and no exclamation marks:\n   - \"Please lock the door on your way out.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"The museum closes early on Mondays.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"She plays the piano every evening.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"Turn left at the second traffic light.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"The bakery opens at seven tomorrow.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"Add garlic and stir for three minutes.\" (False, 0 ?, 0 !)\n   - \"Congratulations on your promotion!\" (False, 0 ?, 1 !)\n\nSo, Option B would accept strings with zero question marks and no exclamation marks, but those are marked False in the examples. Therefore, Option B is not correct.\n\nOption A requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. All True examples fit this, and all False examples violate it (either more than one question mark, or zero question marks, or any exclamation mark).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n20. Is this address correct for the courier? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n21. Did you finish reading the last chapter? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n22. Should I bring a jacket for the evening? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n23. Would it help if I arrived early? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n24. Do you want to split the bill? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n25. Do you need help carrying those boxes? (1 question mark, no exclamation) → True\n\nAll of these have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples, especially those with zero question marks:\n\n- The dog slept through the storm. (0 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- The printer is out of ink again. (0 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- I finally figured it out! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- She plays the piano every evening. (0 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday. (0 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Please, just listen to me! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- The password was changed yesterday.

(0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- It's so good to hear from you! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- Please send the report by Friday. (0 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- That was intense! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- Congratulations on your promotion! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n\nSo, sentences with zero question marks are always False, even if there are no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples with more than one question mark:\n\n- Is anyone home? Hello? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Are you on your way? Do you need directions? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Are we late? Did the movie already start? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did you save the document? Did you close the app?

(2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Have you tried this method? Did it help? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did you call Alex? Did they answer? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?

(2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n\nSo, more than one question mark is always False.\n\nNow, let's check if any True example has zero question marks. None do.\n\nSo, the rule is: exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n\nOption A matches this: exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n\nOption B would accept zero question marks, but all zero question mark examples are False.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

True examples always have exactly one question mark.\n   - \"Is anyone using the conference room now?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did you manage to fix the printer jam?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have you backed up the files recently?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Could we try a different approach next time?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can you read that sign from here?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can we move the appointment to 3 pm?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the guest list final now?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did you finish reading the last chapter?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Do you want to split the bill?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is there a vegetarian menu I can look at?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Could you check the door before we leave?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have they posted the results online?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Do you mind if I open a window?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Are tables available outside right now?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will we need umbrellas this afternoon?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the package insured during shipping?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Could I ask a quick question about the form?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will your presentation include a demo?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Are the tickets refundable if plans change?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Are you free to talk after the meeting?\" (1 ?)\n\n2. False examples include:\n   - Sentences with exclamation marks (regardless of question marks): \"Keep the change!\", \"Don't forget your jacket!\", etc.\n   - Sentences with more than one question mark: \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 ?), \"Is that thunder?

Are you sure?\" — Two question marks.\n- \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" — Two question marks.\n\nIt appears that all False examples with question marks have either more than one question mark or have exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's check if any True examples have zero question marks:\n- All True examples are questions and have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check if any True examples have more than one question mark:\n- No, all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nSo, Option A says: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B says: at most one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nIf Option B were correct, then a sentence with zero question marks and no exclamation marks would be accepted.

Is the ground still wet?\n\nNow, let's analyze the rules:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test these options with the examples.\n\nFirst, Option B (exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks):\n\n- \"Can you read that sign from here?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n- \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n- \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by B. OK.\n\nSo, Option B seems to fit so far.\n\nNow, Option A (no exclamation marks, at most one question mark):\n\n- \"Can you read that sign from here?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n- \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n- \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted.\n\nSo, both A and B fit these cases.\n\nNow, let's look for a case where there is 0 question marks and no exclamation marks.\n\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (False): 0 question marks, no exclamation mark. According to A, this should be accepted, but it's False. So A is not correct.\n\nNow, let's look for a case where there is 1 question mark and an exclamation mark.\n\n- \"You lost your passport?!\" (False): 1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark. Both A and B would not accept this. OK.\n\nNow, let's look for a case where there is 0 question marks and an exclamation mark.\n\n- \"Keep the change!\" (False): 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark. Both A and B would not accept this. OK.\n\nNow, let's look for a case where there is exactly one question mark and no exclamation mark.\n\n- \"Can you read that sign from here?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted by B.\n- \"Is the car ready for pickup?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted by B.\n\nNow, let's look for a case where there is 0 question marks and no exclamation mark, and see if any are True.\n\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (False): 0 question marks, no exclamation mark. According to A, this should be accepted, but it's False. So A is not correct.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n- All True examples are questions, ending with a question mark.\n- Some True examples have \"Do\", \"Will\", \"Can\", \"Is\", \"Are\", \"May\", \"Did\", \"Have\", \"Could\", \"Would\" at the start, but that's not the rule being tested here.\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n- None of the True examples have exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n- Some False examples have exclamation marks (e.g., \"So many people showed up!\", \"Stop right there!\", \"Please, not again!\", \"That was intense!\").\n- Some False examples have more than one question mark (e.g., \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\", \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\", \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\", \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\").\n- Some False examples have no question marks at all (e.g., \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\", \"The printer is out of ink again.\", \"Dinner is ready in ten minutes.\", etc.).\n- Some False examples have one question mark, but are not accepted (e.g., \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\", \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\"). But in these cases, there are two questions, so two question marks.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- This would allow zero or one question mark, as long as there are no exclamation marks.\n- But in the True examples, there are no examples with zero question marks. All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n- So, Option A would incorrectly accept statements with zero question marks, which is not seen in the True examples.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- This matches all True examples: exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples either have more than one question mark, zero question marks, or an exclamation mark.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

(1 question mark, no exclamation)\n- Will the storm affect our travel plans? (1 question mark, no exclamation)\n- Will you be driving or taking the train?

(1 question mark, no exclamation)\n- Is there a quieter room we can use? (1 question mark, no exclamation)\n- Are we still going hiking this weekend? (1 question mark, no exclamation)\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples that are similar:\n\n- Are we late? Did the movie already start? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Can we take a break? Are you tired? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Will the bus be late? Should we walk? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did you see the comet? Was it bright? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Who called earlier? Was it important? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- Did you call Alex? Did they answer? (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n\nSo, it seems that more than one question mark makes it False, even if there are no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's check for exclamation marks:\n\n- What a beautiful garden! (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- Add garlic and stir for three minutes. (0 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- The museum closes early on Mondays. (0 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- Bring a sweater because it gets chilly. (0 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- She plays the piano every evening. (0 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- The cake turned out perfectly! (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- Watch out for the step! (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- The password was changed yesterday. (0 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- So many people showed up! (1 exclamation, 0 question) → False\n- You really did that? Incredible! (1 exclamation, 1 question) → False\n\nSo, any exclamation mark makes it False, even if there is only one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check for 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n\n- She left a note on the table. (0 question, 0 exclamation) → False\n- The dog slept through the storm. (0 question, 0 exclamation) → False\n- The printer jammed again during the rush. (0 question, 0 exclamation) → False\n\nSo, 0 question marks is not accepted.\n\nNow, let's check for 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n\n- All True examples above.\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nOption A would accept 0 question marks, but those are all False.\nOption B would accept only exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches all the True examples and none of the False ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

All False examples with exclamation marks are False. So both rules require no exclamation marks.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Number of Question Marks\n\nLet's look at True examples:\n\n- \"Is the restaurant taking reservations today?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you booked the venue for June?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did your phone update overnight?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you want to split the bill?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do we need a permit to film here?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you have time for a quick call?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do we have enough chairs for everyone?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a quieter room we can use?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I get a receipt for this purchase?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did the landlord respond to your email?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the printer out of ink again?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I save my progress without logging in?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are you interested in joining our study group?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there parking behind the museum?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would you mind closing the window?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will the conference provide translation services?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I get directions to the gallery?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are the meeting notes in the shared folder?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you backed up the files recently?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did the committee approve the proposal?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is anyone using the conference room now?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did you water the plants before you left?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you tried the new bakery on Pine Street?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could we try a different approach next time?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the package insured during shipping?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could you remind me of the deadline?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this the line for tickets?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"May we switch seats so I can sit by the window?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the Wi-Fi password written somewhere?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is your laptop compatible with the projector?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this address correct for the courier?\" (1 question mark)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at False examples with more than one question mark:\n\n- \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Will the bus be late?

Can I shut down?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\" (2 question marks)\n\nAll these are False.\n\nAre there any False examples with zero question marks and no exclamation marks?\n\n- \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Happy birthday to you!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) — False (but has exclamation mark)\n- \"That joke was hilarious!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) — False\n- \"Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"We camped by the lake last summer.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) — False\n- \"The answer is obvious!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) — False\n\nSo, all True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. All False examples have either more than one question mark, or zero question marks, or exclamation marks.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: At Most One vs. Exactly One\n\nOption A would allow zero question marks (as long as there are no exclamation marks). But all zero-question-mark, no-exclamation-mark examples are False.\n\nOption B requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. This matches all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the correct rule.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

(no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Is the pool open today? Do we need towels? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?

(2 question marks, no exclamation)\n\nFrom the False examples, we see:\n- Some have no question marks and no exclamation marks (False)\n- Some have more than one question mark (False)\n- Some have exclamation marks (False)\n- Some have one question mark, but the second sentence is not a question (but the string as a whole only has one question mark, so this is a bit ambiguous)\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- This would mean that strings with 0 or 1 question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted.\n- But in the False examples, \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) is False.\n- So this rule would incorrectly classify that as True, but it's False.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples either have 0 question marks, more than 1 question mark, or any exclamation marks.\n- This fits all the data.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

False: \"So many people showed up!\"  \n   - 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark → Not accepted by either.\n\n10. False: \"Unbelievable performance!\"  \n    - 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark → Not accepted by either.\n\n11. False: \"You lost your passport?!\"  \n    - 1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark → Not accepted by either.\n\n12. True: \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\"  \n    - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Accepted by both.\n\n13.

(1 ?)\n- May I borrow your charger for a moment? (1 ?)\n- Can I save my progress without logging in? (1 ?)\n- Did your phone update overnight? (1 ?)\n\nAll of these have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\n### False Examples:\n- You lost your passport?! (contains !)\n- Stop right there! (contains !)\n- Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (2 ?)\n- How long will it take? Will traffic be bad? (2 ?)\n- Is the door locked? Did you check twice? (2 ?)\n- What a surprise to see you here!

(0 ?)\n\nAll of these either have more than one question mark, or at least one exclamation mark, or zero question marks.\n\n### Now, let's check the options:\n\n#### Option A: At most one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- Accepts: 0 or 1 question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- But in the False examples, sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks (e.g., \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\", \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\", \"We need to leave by eight.\") are marked False.\n- So Option A would incorrectly accept these, but the examples say they are False.\n\n#### Option B: Exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- Accepts: Only sentences with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All True examples fit this.\n- All False examples do not fit this (they have 0 or more than 1 question mark, or have exclamation marks).\n\n### Conclusion:\nOption B is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Let's look at True examples:\n   - \"Do they offer student discounts here?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Are the meeting notes in the shared folder?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Would an earlier flight be possible?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n\n2. Let's look at False examples with more than one question mark:\n   - \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Is that thunder?

Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n3. Let's look at False examples with 0 question marks:\n   - \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n4. Let's look at False examples with exclamation marks:\n   - \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"Don't forget your jacket!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"It's so good to hear from you!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"Congratulations on your promotion!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"Stop right there!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"You lost your passport?!\" (1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n\n5. Let's look at True examples with 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All True examples fit this pattern.\n\n6. Let's check if any True example has 0 or more than 1 question mark, or any exclamation mark:\n   - No True example has 0 or more than 1 question mark.\n   - No True example has an exclamation mark.\n\n7. Option A says: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n   - This matches all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\n8.

(1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks)\n\nAll of these have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- The cake turned out perfectly! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark)\n- Don't forget your jacket! (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark)\n- Are you coming? Are you sure? (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks)\n- Is there a discount today? Is it stackable? (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks)\n- Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?

Looking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark. There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nTherefore, Option B is more precise: only sentences with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Was it important?\n- Happy birthday to you!\n- Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\n- Congratulations on your promotion!\n- Remember to water the plants before you go.\n- What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Check for exclamation marks:**\n   - All True examples have no exclamation marks.\n   - Some False examples have exclamation marks (e.g., \"What a beautiful garden!\", \"That sunset looks incredible!\", \"Unbelievable performance!\", \"That joke was hilarious!\").\n   - But some False examples do not have exclamation marks (e.g., \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\", \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\").\n\n2. **Check for question marks:**\n   - All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n   - Some False examples have more than one question mark (e.g., \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\", \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\", \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\", \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\", \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\", \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\", \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\", \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\", \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\", \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\", \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\").\n   - Some False examples have no question marks (e.g., \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\", \"He left his umbrella on the train.\", \"We need to leave by eight.\", etc.).\n\n3. **Option A vs Option B:**\n   - Option A requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n   - Option B allows at most one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\n   Let's test Option B: If a string with zero question marks and no exclamation marks should be accepted, but in the False examples, \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (no question mark, no exclamation mark) is False. So Option B is not correct.\n\n   Option A: Only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted. All True examples fit this, and all False examples violate it (either by having more than one question mark, zero question marks, or exclamation marks).\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct rule is Option A.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

All True examples are single questions, each ending with a single question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n2. False examples include:\n   - Sentences with exclamation marks (e.g., \"Stop right there!\").\n   - Sentences with more than one question mark (e.g., \"Are you on your way?

Should I add ice?\").\n   - Sentences with no question marks (e.g., \"The cake turned out perfectly!\").\n   - Sentences with exactly one question mark but are not questions (none observed; all True examples are questions).\n\n3. Let's test the difference between \"exactly one\" (Option A) and \"at most one\" (Option B):\n   - Option A would reject any string with zero or more than one question mark.\n   - Option B would accept strings with zero or one question mark, as long as there are no exclamation marks.\n\n4. In the examples, sentences with zero question marks (e.g., \"The cake turned out perfectly!\") are marked False.

      "response": "Let's analyze the options step by step:\n\n**Option A:**  \n- The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\n**Option B:**  \n- The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's check which option fits the examples:\n\n### 1. Exclamation marks\n- All True examples have no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples with exclamation marks are marked False.\n\nSo, both options require no exclamation marks.\n\n### 2. Number of question marks\n- Option A allows at most one question mark (so zero or one).\n- Option B allows exactly one question mark.\n\nLet's look at True examples:\n- \"Could I get a receipt for this purchase?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Are tables available outside right now?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Is there a vegetarian menu I can look at?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Should I bring a jacket for the evening?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Do you want to split the bill?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Will you send the report by Friday?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Have you booked the venue for June?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Would tomorrow work better for you?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Have you seen my keys anywhere?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Will we need umbrellas this afternoon?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Do we need a permit to film here?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Are the tickets refundable if plans change?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Would it help if I arrived early?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Do we need to print the tickets in advance?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Is this seat taken by anyone?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Did your phone update overnight?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Did you lock the back door?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Is the library card still valid?\" (one question mark) → True\n- \"Are we still going hiking this weekend?\" (one question mark) → True\n\nAre there any True examples with zero question marks? Let's check:\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\n### 3. False examples with more than one question mark\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (two question marks) → False\n- \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (two question marks) → False\n\nSo, more than one question mark is always False.\n\n### 4. False examples with zero question marks\n- \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"The password was changed yesterday.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"Turn left at the second traffic light.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"You did a fantastic job!\" (zero question marks, but has exclamation mark) → False\n- \"Dinner is ready in ten minutes.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"The lights were left on overnight.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"The elevator is out of service today.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"The answer is obvious!\" (zero question marks, but has exclamation mark) → False\n- \"We camped by the lake last summer.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (zero question marks) → False\n- \"Watch out for the step!\" (zero question marks, but has exclamation mark) → False\n\nSo, zero question marks is always False, even if there are no exclamation marks.\n\n### Conclusion\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples have either zero or more than one question mark, or have exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, **Option B** is correct.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

Did you close the app? (2 question marks)\n- Is anyone home? Hello? (2 question marks)\n- Is the file saved? Can I shut down? (2 question marks)\n- Can you hear me? Can you see the screen? (2 question marks)\n- Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip? (2 question marks)\n- Did you see the comet? Was it bright? (2 question marks)\n- Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better? (1 question mark, but \"or would two be better?\" is a question, so possibly 2 implied)\n- Are you on your way? Do you need directions? (2 question marks)\n- Is the door locked? Did you check twice? (2 question marks)\n- Is that your notebook? Where did you get it? (2 question marks)\n\nAlso, False examples with exclamation marks:\n\n- The lanterns lit the path to the gate. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- I finally figured it out! (exclamation)\n- Dinner is ready in ten minutes. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- The meeting starts at nine sharp. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- You lost your passport?! (question and exclamation)\n- That sunset looks incredible! (exclamation)\n- The printer jammed again during the rush. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Congratulations on your promotion! (exclamation)\n- The museum closes early on Mondays. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Add garlic and stir for three minutes. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- She left a note on the table. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- The password was changed yesterday. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Turn the music down! (exclamation)\n- What a beautiful garden! (exclamation)\n- We watched the clouds roll over the hills. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nKey difference: Option A allows for 0 or 1 question mark, Option B only allows exactly 1 question mark.\n\nLet's check if any True examples have 0 question marks.\n\nLooking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark. There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nTherefore, Option A would incorrectly accept sentences with 0 question marks, but none of the True examples have 0 question marks.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Do you have a spare?\" is marked False.\n  - \"Is the file saved? Can I shut down?\" is marked False.\n  - \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" is marked False.\n  - \"Can you hear me?

Let's look at some True examples:\n   - \"Have they announced the winners yet?\" (True) — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Would you mind closing the window?\" (True) — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Can we share a taxi to the airport?\" (True) — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (True) — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks.\n\n2. Let's look at some False examples:\n   - \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n\n3. Let's check for 0 question marks:\n   - \"We need to leave by eight.\" (False) — 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"The cake turned out perfectly!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n   - \"The elevator is out of service today.\" (False) — 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n\n4. Let's check for exclamation marks:\n   - \"The cake turned out perfectly!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n   - \"Stop right there!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n   - \"You lost your passport?!\" (False) — 1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark.\n\n5. Let's check for True with 0 question marks:\n   - There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\n6. Let's check for True with more than 1 question mark:\n   - There are no True examples with more than 1 question mark.\n\n7. Let's check for True with 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All True examples fit this pattern.\n\n8. Let's check for False with 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" (False) — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks, but also a second sentence without a question mark.\n   - \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n\nBut \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" is False, even though it has 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks. But it is two sentences, one with a question mark, one without.\n\nSo, Option A: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B: no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nIf Option B were correct, then a sentence with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks would be True, but \"We need to leave by eight.\" is False.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Let's check if any True example has zero question marks:\n\nLooking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark.

Should I add ice?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n- \"Is this the right cable?

Did they leave a slip?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → False\n\nAll of these have 2 question marks and no exclamation marks, and are marked False. This means that \"at most one question mark\" is required for True.\n\nNow, let's check for any True examples with zero question marks:\n- There are no True examples with zero question marks. All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's check for any False examples with zero question marks:\n- \"You were right all along!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"It's so good to hear from you!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"That was the best meal I've had all year!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"Unbelievable performance!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"That was intense!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"That sunset looks incredible!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation) → False\n- \"You really did that? Incredible!\" (1 question mark, 1 exclamation) → False\n\nSo, exclamation marks are not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check for any True examples with zero question marks:\n- There are none. All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nSo, Option A: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B: at most one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nIf Option B were correct, then a sentence with zero question marks and no exclamation marks would be True.

All True examples have exactly one question mark. So, Option A would allow 0 or 1 question mark, but in the data, there are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nNow, let's check if any False example has 0 question marks and no exclamation marks. Yes, for example:\n- There is a note on your desk. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- The auditorium lights dimmed slowly. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- The printer jammed again during the rush. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- Dinner is ready in ten minutes. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- They relocated the meeting to Room 204. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- She plays the piano every evening. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- We watched the clouds roll over the hills. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- Please send the report by Friday. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n- It was quieter after the power outage. (no question mark, no exclamation mark)\n\nIf Option A were correct, these would be True, but they are False.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Let's look at some True examples:\n   - \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Are you free to talk after the meeting?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n   - \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → True\n\n2. Let's look at some False examples:\n   - \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Can we take a break? Are you tired?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n3. Let's check for exclamation marks:\n   - \"You lost your passport?!\" (1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n   - \"This is amazing!!\" (0 question marks, 2 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → False\n\n4. Let's check for 0 question marks:\n   - \"Dinner is ready in ten minutes.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n   - \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n5. Let's check for 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All True examples fit this pattern.\n\n6. Let's check for 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All are False.\n\n7. Let's check for 1 question mark and 1 exclamation mark:\n   - All are False.\n\n8. Let's check for 2 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All are False.\n\nSo, the rule must be: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nOption A says: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B says: at most one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nBut, in the False examples, strings with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks are False, so Option B is too broad.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's restate the options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nLet's look at the True and False examples:\n\n1. True examples always have exactly one question mark.\n   - \"Will we need umbrellas this afternoon?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can I save my progress without logging in?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the blue folder on your desk?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did your phone update overnight?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Are these seats reserved for guests?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is there parking behind the museum?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will the cafe be open on Sunday?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will the storm affect our travel plans?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did the landlord respond to your email?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have they posted the results online?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did you water the plants before you left?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have you met the new neighbor yet?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is your laptop compatible with the projector?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will you send the report by Friday?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have you checked the flight status?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is this fabric machine washable?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Are you free to talk after the meeting?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the car ready for pickup?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Can we share a taxi to the airport?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Do you have time for a quick call?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is there a quieter room we can use?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did you lock the back door?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the theater accessible by tram?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will your presentation include a demo?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Did you get my message earlier?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Is the guest list final now?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have they announced the winners yet?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Will the conference provide translation services?\" (1 ?)\n   - \"Have you tried the new bakery on Pine Street?\" (1 ?)\n\n2. False examples:\n   - Some have no question marks: \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (0 ?)\n   - Some have more than one question mark: \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (2 ?)\n   - Some have exclamation marks: \"You lost your passport?!\" (1 ? + 1 !)\n   - Some have both: \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Do we have bread? Do we need milk?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 ?)\n   - \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 ?)\n\nSo, the True examples always have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. The False examples are False if they have more than one question mark, or if they have an exclamation mark, or if they have zero question marks.\n\nNow, let's compare the options:\n\n- Option A: Accepts only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- Option B: Accepts strings with zero or one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nBut in the examples, strings with zero question marks are always False, so Option B would incorrectly accept those.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Let's look at some False examples:\n   - \"Will the bus be late? Should we walk?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False) — 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - \"Are we late?

Let's check for cases with 1 question mark and 1 exclamation mark:\n   - There are no such examples, but all examples with exclamation marks are False.\n\n5. Let's check for cases with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (False)\n   - \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (False)\n   - \"Dinner is ready in ten minutes.\" (False)\n   - \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (False)\n   - \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (False)\n   - \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\" (False)\n   - \"The museum closes early on Mondays.\" (False)\n   - \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" (False)\n   - \"You were right all along!\" (False)\n   - \"Keep the change!\" (False)\n   - \"That joke was hilarious!\" (False)\n   - \"The answer is obvious!\" (False)\n   - \"We need to leave by eight.\" (False)\n   - \"Unbelievable performance!\" (False)\n   - \"It was quieter after the power outage.\" (False)\n   - \"We won the match!\" (False)\n   - \"What a relief!\" (False)\n   - \"This plan works perfectly!\" (False)\n\n6.

Let's check for cases with more than 1 question mark and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All are False.\n\n8. Let's check for cases with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - All are False.\n\n9.

Do you have a spare?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted (more than one question mark).\n  - Option B: Not accepted (not exactly one question mark).\n\n- \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\n- \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" — False\n  - 2 question marks, no exclamation mark.\n  - Option A: Not accepted.\n  - Option B: Not accepted.\n\nNow, let's look for any True example with zero question marks:\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look for any False example with exactly one question mark and no exclamation mark:\n- There are no such examples.\n\nNow, let's look for any True example with more than one question mark:\n- There are none.\n\nNow, let's look for any True example with zero question marks:\n- There are none.\n\nSo, both rules seem to fit the data so far. Let's look for a difference.\n\nOption A allows zero question marks, as long as there are no exclamation marks.\nOption B requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nAre there any True examples with zero question marks? No.\nAre there any False examples with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks? No.\n\nBut, the new text: \"Will you send the report by Friday?\" — True\n- 1 question mark, no exclamation mark.\n\nSo, both rules would accept this.\n\nBut let's look at the False examples with no question marks and no exclamation marks:\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\" — False\n- \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\" — False\n- \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" — False\n- \"This is amazing!!\" — False (has exclamation marks)\n- \"Watch out for the step!\" — False (has exclamation mark)\n- \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" — False\n- \"That joke was hilarious!\" — False (has exclamation mark)\n- \"The password was changed yesterday.\" — False\n- \"She plays the piano every evening.\" — False\n- \"The museum closes early on Mondays.\" — False\n- \"That sunset looks incredible!\" — False (has exclamation mark)\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" — False\n- \"The cake turned out perfectly!\" — False\n- \"I love this song!\" — False (has exclamation mark)\n- \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" — False\n- \"You really did that? Incredible!\" — False (has question mark and exclamation mark)\n\nSo, all sentences with zero question marks are False.\n\nTherefore, Option A would accept sentences with zero question marks and no exclamation marks, but in the data, all such sentences are False.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule: \"The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\"\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n- \"Are you on your way?

Are we close?\").\n- All False examples with zero question marks are False (e.g., \"We need to leave by eight.\").\n\nBut let's check for True examples with zero question marks: None.\nCheck for True examples with more than one question mark: None.\n\nSo, all True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, check for False examples with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks:\n- \"Is this seat free?

Let's look at some True examples:\n   - \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) → fits both A and B.\n   - \"Are tables available outside right now?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) → fits both A and B.\n   - \"Can we share a taxi to the airport?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) → fits both A and B.\n\n2. Let's look at some False examples:\n   - \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → Option A: not exactly one, Option B: more than one, so both would reject.\n   - \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → both would reject.\n   - \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → both would reject.\n   - \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, but the second sentence is not a question, so only 1 question mark) → This is marked False. Option A: exactly one question mark, so would accept. Option B: at most one question mark, so would accept. But it's marked False, so maybe the rule is more specific.\n\n3. Let's look at more True examples:\n   - \"Is there a vegetarian menu I can look at?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) → fits both.\n   - \"Is the blue folder on your desk?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) → fits both.\n\n4. Let's look at more False examples:\n   - \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → both would reject.\n   - \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → both would reject.\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation mark) → both would reject.\n\n5. Let's look at the edge case:\n   - \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, but the second sentence is not a question, so only 1 question mark) → marked False. This suggests that the rule is not just about the number of question marks, but about the number of questions.\n\n6. Let's check for exclamation marks:\n   - All True examples have no exclamation marks.\n   - All False examples with exclamation marks are False.\n\n7. Let's check for zero question marks:\n   - \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False.\n   - \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation mark) → False.\n   - So, zero question marks is always False.\n\n8.

But this is marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n- \"There is a note on your desk.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted. Marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n- \"Please send the report by Friday.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted. Marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n- \"They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted. Marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n- \"We camped by the lake last summer.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted. Marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n- \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (0 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted. Marked False, so Option B would incorrectly accept this.\n\nSo, Option B would accept strings with zero question marks and no exclamation marks, but these are marked False. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\nOption A only accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

You must pick one of the rules.\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nRespond with JSON: {\"answer\":\"A\"} or {\"answer\":\"B\"}, but make sure to think step-by-step first and show all of your reasoning.",
      "response": "Let's analyze the options and the examples step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the difference between the two options:\n\n- Option A: Accept if there is exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- Option B: Accept if there are no exclamation marks and at most one question mark (so zero or one question mark).\n\nNow, let's look at the True and False examples:\n\n1. Many True examples are questions, e.g. \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (one question mark, no exclamation mark).\n2. Some True examples are requests or offers, e.g. \"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (one question mark, no exclamation mark).\n3. All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\" (two question marks, no exclamation marks) → False.\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (two question marks, no exclamation marks) → False.\n- \"Is the file saved? Can I shut down?\" (two question marks, no exclamation marks) → False.\n- \"Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice?\" (two question marks, no exclamation marks) → False.\n- \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (two question marks, no exclamation marks) → False.\n- \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (one question mark, but also another question, so two question marks in total) → False.\n\nSo, if a string has more than one question mark, it's always False.\n\nNow, let's check if a string with zero question marks and no exclamation marks is ever True.\n\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (no question mark, no exclamation mark) → False.\n- \"The auditorium lights dimmed slowly.\" (no question mark, no exclamation mark) → False.\n- \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (no question mark, no exclamation mark) → False.\n\nSo, zero question marks and no exclamation marks is always False.\n\nNow, let's check if a string with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks is always True.\n\n- \"Will a digital copy be acceptable?\" (one question mark, no exclamation mark) → True.\n- \"Is the printer out of ink again?\" (one question mark, no exclamation mark) → True.\n- \"Is this the correct platform for the train?\" (one question mark, no exclamation mark) → True.\n\nSo, this matches.\n\nNow, let's check if a string with one question mark and an exclamation mark is ever True.\n\n- \"What a surprise to see you here!\" (no question mark, one exclamation mark) → False.\n- \"This is amazing!!\" (no question mark, two exclamation marks) → False.\n\nNo True examples with exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's check if a string with zero question marks and no exclamation marks is ever True. Already checked: always False.\n\nSo, Option A: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, matches all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\nOption B: at most one question mark and no exclamation marks, would accept zero question marks and no exclamation marks, but those are always False.\n\nTherefore, Option A is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

What are you thinking? Tell me now.\"  \n  - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks → fits A (not exactly one), fits B (more than one question mark, so not accepted)\n- \"Can I borrow your pen?

Many True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. This fits both A and B.\n2. Some False examples have more than one question mark (e.g., \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\"), which would be rejected by both A and B.\n3. Some False examples have no question marks at all (e.g., \"You were right all along!\"), which would be rejected by both A and B.\n4. Some False examples have exclamation marks, which would be rejected by both A and B.\n5. The key difference is that Option A allows for zero question marks, as long as there are no exclamation marks, while Option B requires exactly one question mark.\n\nBut looking at the True examples, all of them have exactly one question mark. There are no True examples with zero question marks.\n\nAlso, in the False examples, \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" has one question mark, but also another sentence, so more than one sentence, and is marked False. But the main difference is that all True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nTherefore, Option B is more precise: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Is the ground still wet?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"Will the bus be late? Should we walk?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, more than one question mark is not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check if \"at most one question mark\" is sufficient, or if it must be \"exactly one\".\n\n- \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"Don't forget your jacket!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n- \"Add garlic and stir for three minutes.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"Please lock the door on your way out.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n- \"The dog slept through the storm.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks are marked False. This means that \"at most one\" is too broad, because 0 question marks is not accepted.\n\nNow, let's check if \"no exclamation marks\" is necessary.\n\n- \"You did a fantastic job!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n- \"This is amazing!!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 2 exclamation marks.\n- \"The answer is obvious!\" (False) — 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark.\n\nSo, exclamation marks are not allowed.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"Are the tickets refundable if plans change?\" — 1 question mark, no exclamation marks. Marked True.\n\nSo, the rule is: exactly one question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n\n**Option B** matches this: \"The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\"\n\n**Option A** is too broad, because it would accept 0 question marks, which is not the case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

OK.\n- \"Is the lake safe for swimming today?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n- \"Do we need to print the tickets in advance?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n\nBut what about \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (True): 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n\nNow, let's look at a False example: \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. This would be rejected by both rules.\n\nNow, let's look at \"What happened? What are you thinking? Tell me now.\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"You lost your passport?!\" (False): 1 question mark, 1 exclamation mark. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Will the bus be late? Should we walk?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Why now? Why here?\" (False): 2 question marks, no exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"What a relief!\" (False): 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"This is amazing!!\" (False): 0 question marks, 2 exclamation marks. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"Her train arrives at 10:14.\" (False): 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks. Option A would accept this, but it's marked False. Option B would not accept it, since it requires exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at \"The cake turned out perfectly!\" (False): 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark. Rejected by both.\n\nNow, let's look at \"She left a note on the table.\" (False): 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks. Option A would accept this, but it's marked False.\n\nSo, Option A would accept any sentence with 0 or 1 question mark and no exclamation marks. But in the False examples, there are sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks that are marked False.\n\nTherefore, Option A is not correct.\n\nOption B requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. All False examples either have more than one question mark, or exclamation marks, or no question marks at all.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Are you sure?\n- You were right all along!\n- I can't believe it's raining again!\n- Please, just listen to me!\n- She left a note on the table.\n- Remember to water the plants before you go.\n\nNow, let's analyze the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test these options with the examples.\n\nFirst, Option B: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\n- \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n- \"Do you need help carrying those boxes?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n- \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"Why now? Why here?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"Did you call Alex? Did they answer?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n- \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Should be False. OK.\n\nSo far, Option B fits.\n\nNow, let's check for any True examples that do NOT have exactly one question mark.\n\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation mark.\n\nNow, let's check Option A: no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\n- \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. OK.\n- \"Dinner is ready in ten minutes.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation mark. According to Option A, this should be True, but it's False. So Option A does not fit.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Is this the correct platform for the train? (1 question mark, no exclamation)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The printer jammed again during the rush. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- The museum closes early on Mondays. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- We finally finished the project! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- Her train arrives at 10:14. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Are we there yet? Are we close? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Can we take a break? Are you tired? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- What a surprise to see you here! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- Are you coming? Are you sure? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- I can't believe it's raining again! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- Is the door locked? Did you check twice? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- It was quieter after the power outage. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- That was intense! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- Can you hear me? Can you see the screen? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Is this your coat? Or is it theirs? (1 question mark, no exclamation) <-- This one is tricky, but \"Or is it theirs?\" is a question, so actually 2 question marks.\n- Is this seat free? May I join you? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- The meeting starts at nine sharp. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Add garlic and stir for three minutes. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- Why now? Why here? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- Who called earlier? Was it important? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- This is amazing!! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- Will the bus be late? Should we walk? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- You really did that? Incredible! (1 question mark, has exclamation)\n- Is anyone home? Hello? (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- That sunset looks incredible! (no question mark, has exclamation)\n- The elevator is out of service today. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n- We camped by the lake last summer. (no question mark, no exclamation)\n\nSo, all False examples either:\n- Have no question mark (and no exclamation), or\n- Have more than one question mark, or\n- Have any exclamation mark (even with a question mark).\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts strings with no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- This would accept strings with 0 or 1 question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n- But in the False examples, there are sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks (e.g., \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\") that are marked False. So Option A would incorrectly accept these.\n\nOption B: Accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- This matches all True examples (all have exactly one question mark, no exclamation).\n- This rejects all False examples (those with 0 or more than 1 question mark, or any exclamation mark).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Option B would accept (since at most one question mark), but the example is False, so Option B is not correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is correct because only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted.

Any with more than one question mark are out. Any with zero question marks and no exclamation marks? Let's check: \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (False, 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks). This would be accepted by Option A, but it's marked False.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n- True examples: All have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. But \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (True, 0 question marks, no exclamation marks) would not be accepted by Option B.\n- False examples: Any with more than one question mark are out. Any with exclamation marks are out. Any with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks? All True examples fit, but \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" is a counterexample.\n\nSo, Option A allows 0 or 1 question mark, no exclamation marks. Option B only allows exactly 1 question mark, no exclamation marks.\n\nBut \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (True, 0 question marks, no exclamation marks) is True, so Option B is too restrictive.\n\nOption A is the only one that fits all the True and False examples, except for \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\" (False, 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks).

      "response": "Let's analyze the options step by step:\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the examples and see which rule fits better.\n\n### Step 1: Exclamation Marks\n\nAll True examples have no exclamation marks. All False examples with exclamation marks are marked False. So both rules correctly require no exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 2: Number of Question Marks\n\nLet's look at the True examples:\n- \"Have you backed up the files recently?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you prefer tea or coffee in the morning?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we allowed to bring outside food?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this the line for tickets?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I ask a quick question about the form?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there parking behind the museum?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can this recipe be doubled without issues?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I walk there from the hotel?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the blue folder on your desk?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Have you booked the venue for June?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this address correct for the courier?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Could I try a sample before ordering?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are the instructions clear enough to follow?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Can I get directions to the gallery?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are you interested in joining our study group?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is this seat taken by anyone?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Would tomorrow work better for you?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Did you lock the back door?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is there a vegetarian menu I can look at?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Should I bring a jacket for the evening?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will you send the report by Friday?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the museum open late on Thursdays?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Do you have time for a quick call?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Will we need umbrellas this afternoon?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Are we still going hiking this weekend?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the library card still valid?\" (1 question mark)\n- \"Is the Wi-Fi password written somewhere?\" (1 question mark)\n\nAll True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n- \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Are we late? Did the movie already start?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Are you on your way? Do you need directions?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Are we there yet? Are we close?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 question marks)\n- \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, but \"Or would two be better?\" is not a question mark in the text, but let's check the original text: \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" -- actually, that's two sentences, but only one question mark. But it's marked False.)\n\nSo, in the False examples, any with more than one question mark are always False. But \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" is marked False, but only has one question mark. Let's look at that.\n\n### Step 3: At Most One Question Mark\n\nOption A allows at most one question mark. Option B requires exactly one question mark.\n\nBut \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" is False, even though it has only one question mark. Why? Because it is two questions, but only one is written with a question mark. The second is a question, but written as a statement.\n\nBut in terms of punctuation, it only has one question mark.\n\n### Step 4: Are There Any True Examples With Zero Question Marks?\n\nLet's check: All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\n### Step 5: Are There Any False Examples With Zero Question Marks?\n\nYes, many: \"Happy birthday to you!\", \"That was the best meal I've had all year!\", etc.\n\n### Step 6: Are There Any True Examples With More Than One Question Mark?\n\nNo.\n\n### Step 7: Are There Any False Examples With Exactly One Question Mark?\n\nYes: \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (only one question mark, but marked False).\n\nSo, Option A says \"at most one question mark\", so it would accept zero or one question mark. But all True examples have exactly one question mark, and all False examples with zero question marks are False.\n\nOption B says \"exactly one question mark\", which matches all True examples.\n\nBut \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" is a tricky case. It has only one question mark, but is marked False. Why? Because it is two questions, but only one is punctuated as a question.\n\nBut the rule is about punctuation, not semantics.\n\n### Step 8: Final Decision\n\nGiven that all True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, and all False examples either have zero or more than one question mark, or have exclamation marks, Option B is the better fit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Or would two be better?\" This has two question marks, but was marked True.\n- All False examples with two question marks are marked False.\n- All False examples with exclamation marks are marked False.\n\nOption B: Exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n\n- Many True examples have exactly one question mark.\n- But the last True example (\"Can we meet at noon?

This would be allowed by Option A (since \"at most one\" is not strictly enforced in the examples), but not by Option B (which requires exactly one).\n\nHowever, Option A says \"at most one question mark,\" but the last example has two question marks and is marked True. This suggests that Option A is not strictly correct either, unless the rule is more about \"no exclamation marks and only questions,\" but that's not what the options say.\n\nBut between the two, Option A is more consistent with the data, since Option B would exclude the last True example.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Accepted.\n- \"Did you finish reading the last chapter?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n\nBut what about:\n- \"Are the meeting notes in the shared folder?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n\nNow, let's look at a False example:\n- \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\" (False) — 2 question marks, no exclamation mark. Not accepted by Option B (needs exactly one question mark). Correctly rejected.\n\nBut what about:\n- \"Could we postpone until after lunch?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n\nNow, let's look at a True example that might break Option B:\n- \"Have you seen my keys anywhere?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n\nBut what about a True example with 0 question marks?\n- There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nNow, let's look at Option A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\n- \"Do you have time for a quick call?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n- \"Could I ask a quick question about the form?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n- \"Did you finish reading the last chapter?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n- \"Could someone cover my shift tomorrow?\" (True) — 1 question mark, no exclamation mark. Accepted.\n\nWhat about a True example with 0 question marks?\n- There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\nWhat about a False example with 0 question marks?\n- \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (False) — 0 question marks, no exclamation mark. Option A would accept this, but it's False. So Option A is not correct.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Or would two be better?\n- We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\n- I finally figured it out!\n- Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\n- Are you coming?

Did it help?\n- Remember to water the plants before you go.\n- The forecast predicts heavy snow.\n- They relocated the meeting to Room 204.\n- Please send the report by Friday.\n- The printer is out of ink again.\n\nNow, let's check the rules:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test these rules with some examples:\n\n1. \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (False)\n   - Contains one question mark, but also \"Or would two be better?\" (which is another question, but no question mark). But the string as a whole has only one question mark. According to A, it's accepted (since at most one question mark), but it's False. According to B, exactly one question mark, so accepted, but it's False. So both rules fail here.\n\nWait, let's check more carefully: Actually, \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" has two question marks. So both rules would reject it (since A: at most one, B: exactly one). So both are consistent here.\n\n2. \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n3. \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n4. \"Do we have bread? Do we need milk?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n5. \"Have you tried this method? Did it help?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n6. \"Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n7. \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n8. \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n9. \"Who called earlier? Was it important?\" (False)\n   - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n10. \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (False)\n    - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n11. \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (False)\n    - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\n12. \"How long will it take? Will traffic be bad?\" (False)\n    - Two question marks. Both rules would reject.\n\nSo, so far, both rules are consistent.\n\nNow, let's look at a True example:\n\n\"Would you like lemon or mint with your tea?\" (True)\n- One question mark, no exclamation mark. Both rules accept.\n\nNow, let's look at a False example with no question marks:\n\n\"She plays the piano every evening.\" (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. According to A, at most one question mark (so zero is allowed), so A would accept, but it's False. According to B, exactly one question mark, so B would reject, which matches the label.\n\nAnother False example:\n\n\"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. A would accept, but it's False. B would reject, which matches.\n\nAnother False:\n\n\"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. A would accept, but it's False. B would reject, which matches.\n\nAnother False:\n\n\"The dog slept through the storm.\" (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. A would accept, but it's False. B would reject, which matches.\n\nAnother False:\n\n\"The cake turned out perfectly!\" (False)\n- Exclamation mark. Both rules would reject.\n\nAnother False:\n\n\"Close the window right now!\" (False)\n- Exclamation mark. Both rules would reject.\n\nAnother False:\n\n\"Please, not again!\" (False)\n- Exclamation mark. Both rules would reject.\n\nNow, let's look at a True example:\n\n\"Will there be snacks at the workshop?\" (True)\n- One question mark, no exclamation mark. Both rules accept.\n\nNow, let's look at a True example:\n\n\"Do you need help carrying those boxes?\" (True)\n- One question mark, no exclamation mark. Both rules accept.\n\nNow, let's look at a True example:\n\n\"Is the car ready for pickup?\" (True)\n- One question mark, no exclamation mark. Both rules accept.\n\nNow, let's look at a False example:\n\n\"Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday.\" (False)\n- No question mark, no exclamation mark. A would accept, but it's False. B would reject, which matches.\n\nSo, the key difference is that A would accept sentences with zero question marks and no exclamation marks, but these are labeled False. B would only accept sentences with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches the True examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

All True examples have no exclamation marks. So both rules require no exclamation marks.\n\n### Step 2: Check for question marks\n\n#### Option A: Exactly one question mark\n#### Option B: At most one question mark\n\nLet's look at some True examples:\n\n- \"Is there a shuttle from the station?\" (1 question mark, True)\n- \"Will there be vegetarian options at dinner?\" (1 question mark, True)\n- \"Could I get a receipt for this purchase?\" (1 question mark, True)\n- \"Could you send the slides after the talk?\" (1 question mark, True)\n- \"Have you booked the venue for June?\" (1 question mark, True)\n\nAll have exactly one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples with more than one question mark:\n\n- \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks, False)\n- \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (2 question marks, False)\n- \"Are you coming?

All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n\n### Step 3: Check for False examples with zero question marks\n\n- \"We need to leave by eight.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"The meeting starts at nine sharp.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"It was quieter after the power outage.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"Your reservation is confirmed for Tuesday.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"Unbelievable performance!\" (0 question marks, False, but has exclamation mark)\n- \"Keep the change!\" (0 question marks, False, but has exclamation mark)\n- \"She left a note on the table.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"He left his umbrella on the train.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"The password was changed yesterday.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"The lanterns lit the path to the gate.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"We watched the clouds roll over the hills.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"My phone battery died before the call.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"The printer jammed again during the rush.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"Remember to water the plants before you go.\" (0 question marks, False)\n- \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, False)\n\nSo, Option B would allow these to be True, but they are all False.\n\n### Step 4: Check for True examples with more than one question mark\n\nThere are no True examples with more than one question mark.\n\n### Step 5: Check for True examples with zero question marks\n\nThere are no True examples with zero question marks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- All True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- All False examples have either zero or more than one question mark, or have exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Is the ground still wet? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Is the soup too hot? Should I add ice? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better? (2 questions, 1 question mark)\n- Did you see the comet? Was it bright? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Are we there yet? Are we close? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Is this your coat? Or is it theirs? (2 questions, 1 question mark)\n- How long will it take? Will traffic be bad? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Do we have bread? Do we need milk? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Are you coming? Are you sure? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n- Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning? (2 questions, 2 question marks)\n\nNow, let's check the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's test these options:\n\n- True examples: All have no exclamation marks and exactly one question mark. So both A and B fit so far.\n- False examples: Many have more than one question mark (e.g., \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\"), so both A and B would reject these.\n- But some False examples have only one question mark, e.g., \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" and \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" Let's check these:\n    - \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) — Option A would accept, Option B would accept. But it's marked False.\n    - \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation mark) — Option A would accept, Option B would accept. But it's marked False.\n\nThis suggests that the rule is not just about the number of question marks and exclamation marks, but also about the number of questions being asked, or perhaps the structure.\n\nBut let's look at the True examples: all are single, direct questions, not compound or multiple questions.\n\nSo, Option A says \"at most one question mark\" (so 0 or 1), but all True examples have exactly one question mark, and all False examples with 0 question marks are statements, not questions.\n\nOption B says \"exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\" But some False examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, but are still False.\n\nTherefore, neither rule perfectly fits, but Option A is more inclusive (allows 0 or 1 question mark), but the data shows that only single, direct questions with exactly one question mark are True.\n\nBut the False examples \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" and \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" have only one question mark, but are two questions in one sentence. So perhaps the rule is about the number of questions, not just the punctuation.\n\nBut between the two options, Option B is stricter: exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. This matches all True examples, and the False examples with one question mark are actually two questions in one sentence, so perhaps the rule is about the number of questions, not just the punctuation.\n\nBut since the options only mention punctuation, and the True examples always have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, Option B is the better fit.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

All True examples are single questions, each with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n2. False examples include:\n   - Sentences with exclamation marks (e.g., \"This is amazing!!\", \"Turn the music down!\").\n   - Sentences with more than one question mark (e.g., \"Did you see the comet?

Let's look at some examples with 0 question marks and 0 exclamation marks:\n   - \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → False\n\n7. Let's look at some examples with 1 question mark and 1 exclamation mark:\n   - There are no such examples, but all examples with exclamation marks are False.\n\n8.

However, grammatically, it's a single question mark.\n\nOption B: At most one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- This would accept both 0 and 1 question mark, as long as there are no exclamation marks.\n- But all True examples have exactly one question mark, and there are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n- All False examples with 0 question marks are correctly rejected.\n- All False examples with more than one question mark are correctly rejected.\n\nBut the key difference is that Option B would accept sentences with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks, but in the data, all such examples are False.\n\nTherefore, Option A is more precise: it only accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Do you need directions?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation)\n- \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation) -- This was classified as False.\n\nAlso, False examples with exclamation marks are always False.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nIf Option A were correct, then \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation) should be True, but it was classified as False.\n\nIf Option B were correct, then only strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks are accepted. However, \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation) was classified as False, which would contradict Option B as well.\n\nBut let's look closer: All True examples are yes/no questions, while \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" is a choice question (not yes/no). The rule is not about punctuation, but about the type of question.\n\nHowever, the options only refer to punctuation, not question type. Given the options, and the fact that \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation) is False, Option B is more restrictive and matches the True examples, but the new example contradicts both options.\n\nBut since Option A would have accepted the new example as True (since it has 1 question mark, no exclamation), but it was classified as False, Option A cannot be correct.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the better fit, as it is more restrictive and matches the True examples, even though the new example is an exception.\n\nSo, the best answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Many True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks. This fits both A and B.\n2. Some False examples have more than one question mark (e.g., \"Are we there yet? Are we close?\"), which would be rejected by both A (since more than one question mark) and B (since not exactly one).\n3. Some False examples have no question marks but also no exclamation marks (e.g., \"She plays the piano every evening.\"). Option A would accept this (since at most one question mark and no exclamation marks), but in the data, it's False. So Option A would be too broad.\n4. Some True examples are statements with no question marks (e.g., \"May we switch seats so I can sit by the window?\")—wait, actually, that is a question. Let's check for any True examples with zero question marks. All True examples seem to have exactly one question mark.\n5. Some False examples have two question marks (e.g., \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\"), which would be rejected by both A and B.\n6. Some False examples have exclamation marks, which would be rejected by both A and B.\n\nThe key difference is that Option A allows zero question marks, but in the data, all True examples have exactly one question mark. Option B requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the options step by step:\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n- Many True examples have one question mark, e.g., \"Is the library card still valid?\"\n- Some True examples have more than one question mark, e.g., \"Will you be driving or taking the train?\" (This is actually one question mark, but let's check for others.)\n- All True examples have no exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n- Some False examples have exclamation marks, e.g., \"Please, not again!\"\n- Some False examples have more than one question mark, e.g., \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (two question marks)\n- Some False examples have no question marks, e.g., \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\"\n- Some False examples have one question mark, but also another question mark or exclamation mark, e.g., \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" (two question marks)\n\nNow, let's test the rules:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- This would allow sentences with zero or one question mark, as long as there are no exclamation marks.\n- But in the True examples, all have exactly one question mark, not zero. Let's check: \"Would tomorrow work better for you?\" (one question mark), \"Have you checked the flight status?\" (one question mark), etc.\n- But \"Are we still going hiking this weekend?\" (one question mark).\n- Are there any True examples with zero question marks? No.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- This matches all True examples: exactly one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n- False examples include those with more than one question mark, e.g., \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (two question marks), and those with exclamation marks, e.g., \"Please, not again!\".\n- False examples also include those with zero question marks, e.g., \"The forecast predicts heavy snow.\"\n\nNow, let's check the new text: \"Did the courier come by? Did they leave a slip?\"\n- Two question marks, so both rules would reject it (since A allows at most one, B allows exactly one).\n\nTherefore, Option B is more precise, as all True examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Let's look at True examples:\n   - \"Do we need to print the tickets in advance?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → fits both A and B.\n   - \"Could you check the door before we leave?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → fits both A and B.\n   - \"Is there a map available at the entrance?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → fits both A and B.\n   - \"Can I get directions to the gallery?\" (1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks) → fits both A and B.\n\n2. Let's look at False examples:\n   - \"Are the tickets refundable? How much is the fee?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted (since \"at most one\").\n   - \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted.\n   - \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted.\n   - \"Where did you put the keys? Did I leave them in the car?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted.\n   - \"Are you coming? Are you sure?\" (2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted.\n\n3. Let's look at False examples with 0 question marks:\n   - \"The printer is out of ink again.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted (since \"at most one\").\n   - \"The dog slept through the storm.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted.\n   - \"Harvest season starts in late September.\" (0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: accepted.\n\n   These are marked False, but Option B would accept them. This means Option B is too broad.\n\n4. Let's look at True examples with 0 question marks:\n   - There are no True examples with 0 question marks.\n\n5.

Let's look at False examples with exclamation marks:\n   - \"This is amazing!!\" (0 question marks, 2 exclamation marks) → both A and B: not accepted.\n   - \"Unbelievable performance!\" (0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark) → both A and B: not accepted.\n\n7. Let's look at True examples with exclamation marks:\n   - There are no True examples with exclamation marks.\n\nConclusion:\n- Option A only accepts strings with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n- Option B accepts strings with at most one question mark and no exclamation marks, so it would accept statements with 0 question marks and no exclamation marks, but those are marked False in the examples.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nLet's look at some key examples:\n\n1. True: Is the restaurant taking reservations today?\n   - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → Accepted by both A and B.\n\n2. False: Is anyone home? Hello?\n   - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks, but two sentences. (But only one question mark in the string.)\n   - Actually, the string is \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" which has one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n   - According to both A and B, this should be accepted, but it's marked False. This suggests that the rule is not just about the number of question marks in the string, but perhaps about the number of questions or sentences.\n\nBut let's look at another:\n\n3. False: Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Option A: At most one question mark → Not accepted.\n   - Option B: Exactly one question mark → Not accepted.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\n4. False: Can we take a break? Are you tired?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\n5. False: Is this the right cable? Did you test it?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\n6. False: Is the pool open today? Do we need towels?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\n7. False: Are we late? Did the movie already start?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\n8. False: Can I borrow your pen? Do you have a spare?\n   - 2 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - Both options would mark this as False, which matches.\n\nNow, let's look for a True example with zero question marks:\n\n- There are no True examples with zero question marks. All True examples are questions.\n\nNow, let's look for a True example with more than one question mark:\n\n- There are no True examples with more than one question mark.\n\nNow, let's look for a False example with exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks:\n\n- False: Is anyone home? Hello?\n   - 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks.\n   - This is marked False, but both A and B would accept it.\n\nBut let's look at the structure: \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" is two sentences, only one of which is a question. But the string as a whole has only one question mark.\n\nBut let's look at the rule wording: \"contains exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks\" (B), or \"contains no exclamation marks and at most one question mark\" (A).\n\nNow, let's look for a True example with zero question marks:\n\n- There are none.\n\nNow, let's look for a False example with one question mark and no exclamation marks:\n\n- False: Is anyone home? Hello?\n- False: Her train arrives at 10:14.\n   - This has no question mark, so not relevant.\n\nSo, the only problematic example is \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" which is False, but both A and B would accept it.\n\nBut let's look at the new text:\n\n\"Will the storm affect our travel plans?\" — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks → True.\n\nSo, both A and B would accept it.\n\nNow, let's look at the difference between A and B:\n\n- A allows 0 or 1 question mark, B only allows exactly 1.\n- Are there any True examples with 0 question marks? No.\n- Are there any False examples with 0 question marks? Yes.\n\nSo, B is more restrictive.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples with 1 question mark and no exclamation marks:\n\n- \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks, but two sentences.\n- \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\" — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks, but two sentences, but actually, this has two question marks.\n\nWait, let's check carefully.\n\n- \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" — 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks, two sentences, only one is a question.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that the string must be a single question, not multiple sentences, and must have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\n\nBut both A and B would accept \"Is anyone home? Hello?\" as True, but it's marked False.\n\nBut the difference between A and B is that A allows 0 question marks, B does not.\n\nAre there any True examples with 0 question marks? No.\n\nTherefore, B is more accurate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Did they answer?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted (correct), Option B: not accepted (correct)\n- \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted (correct), Option B: not accepted (correct)\n- \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, but also another question) → Actually, this is 2 questions, but only 1 question mark. Let's check the text: \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" (1 question mark, no exclamation). Option A: not accepted (since only 1 question mark, but 2 questions). Option B: accepted (since only 1 question mark, no exclamation). But this is marked False. This suggests Option B is not correct.\n- \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Is the door locked? Did you check twice?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Will the bus be late? Should we walk?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Is this seat free? May I join you?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Is there a discount today? Is it stackable?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Did it rain last night? Is the ground still wet?\" (2 question marks, no exclamation) → Option A: not accepted, Option B: not accepted\n- \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" (1 question mark, but 2 questions) → Option A: accepted (since 1 question mark), Option B: accepted (since 1 question mark). But this is marked False. This suggests that the number of questions, not just question marks, matters.\n\nSo, Option B would accept \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" and \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" because they have only one question mark, but they are marked False. Option A would also accept them, but only if the rule is about question marks, not questions.\n\nBut Option A says \"exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks.\" Option B says \"no exclamation marks and at most one question mark.\" But both would accept these, but the examples are marked False.\n\nBut let's look at the True examples: all are single questions, with one question mark, no exclamation marks.\n\nSo, the rule is not just about the number of question marks, but about the sentence being a single question, with one question mark, and no exclamation marks.\n\nOption A is closer, because it requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches the True examples, and the False examples with more than one question mark are not accepted.\n\nOption B would accept sentences with zero question marks, but none of the True examples have zero question marks.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the better fit.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Do any True examples have more than one question mark? No. All True examples have exactly one question mark.\n2. Do any True examples have exclamation marks? No.\n3. Do any False examples have exclamation marks? Yes, some do (e.g., \"That was the best meal I've had all year!\").\n4. Do any False examples have more than one question mark? Yes, several do (e.g., \"Is that your notebook? Where did you get it?\").\n5. Do any False examples have exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks? Let's check:\n   - \"You really did that? Incredible!\" has one question mark, but also an exclamation mark.\n   - \"Is this your coat? Or is it theirs?\" has one question mark, but also another question (so two question marks).\n   - \"Can we take a break? Are you tired?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Did you see the comet? Was it bright?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Did you save the document? Did you close the app?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Are we there yet? Are we close?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Do we have bread? Do we need milk?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Is that thunder? Did you see the lightning?\" has two question marks.\n   - \"Can you hear me? Can you see the screen?\" has two question marks.\n\nSo, all False examples with question marks either have more than one question mark or have exclamation marks.\n\nNow, let's check if any True examples have zero question marks. No, all True examples are questions (ending with a question mark).\n\nTherefore, Option A would allow sentences with zero question marks (statements), but all True examples are questions. Option B requires exactly one question mark and no exclamation marks, which matches all True examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Option A would accept this (since it has 1 question mark, 0 exclamation marks), but it's marked False.\n   - Option B would also accept this, unless the string is considered as a single sentence with multiple questions.\n   - But the string is: \"Can we meet at noon? Or would two be better?\" — that's two questions, but only one question mark. But it's two questions in one sentence, separated by \"Or\".\n   - Let's look for more examples.\n\n8. False: That sunset looks incredible!\n   - 0 question marks, 1 exclamation mark. (Rejected by both)\n9. False: The museum closes early on Mondays.\n   - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks. (Option A would accept, Option B would reject.)\n   - But it's marked False, so Option A is not correct, since it would accept this.\n\nLet's check more:\n\n10.

False: The printer is out of ink again.\n    - 0 question marks, 0 exclamation marks.
