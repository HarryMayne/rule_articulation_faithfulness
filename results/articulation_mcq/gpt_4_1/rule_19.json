No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"The sign read Exit 4 ahead.\"  \n  - \"4\" (no letter).\n- \"They ordered combo number 3 at noon.\"  \n  - \"3\" (no letter).\n- \"The label says Grade A on the carton.\"  \n  -

But many True examples have tokens that do not start with uppercase (e.g., \"set3\", \"task9\", \"z13\", \"size10a\", \"s12\"), or do not end with a digit (e.g., \"Bay4B\", \"R4C\", \"X5G\", \"B12G\").\n- Option B only requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run. All True examples have such a token, and all False examples do not.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption B is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

rules:\n\nOption A: Requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits.  \nBut some True examples have tokens that start with lowercase (e.g., \"z13\", \"i7\", \"k9\", \"lot9B\", \"v2\"). So Option A cannot be correct.\n\nOption B: Requires the token to have at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.  \nAll True examples have such a token (e.g., ZX14, S4, ID7, Bay4B, z13, i7, lot9B, v2, etc.), and all False examples lack such a token.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

False: Call me at 555 0199 if plans change.\n    - \"555\", \"0199\" (digits only) → does not fit A or B.\n\n16. False: Our test was on page ten of the guide.\n    - \"ten\" (letters only) → does not fit A or B.\n\n17.

\"mode3\" (starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit) — Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n- He tested build r12 ahead of release.\n  - \"r12\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digits) — Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n- Her badge read ID7 when she checked in.\n  -

\"Track5\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- The kids loved playing on Platform9 at the park.\n  - \"Platform9\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- Their canoe named River9 had a cracked hull.\n  - \"River9\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- She watered plant A9 twice a week.\n  - \"A9\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- The old camera model X100 still works.\n  - \"X100\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- He pressed key k9 by mistake.\n  - \"k9\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) — Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n- The recipe calls for GradeA2 milk.\n  - \"GradeA2\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- Attach tag R4C to the crate.\n  - \"R4C\" (starts with uppercase, ends with letter) — Option A would not accept, Option B would (since it contains both letter and digit).\n- We found trail marker R12 near the bend.\n  - \"R12\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- Cut along line A10 on the template.\n  - \"A10\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- We sat by Table4 during the rehearsal.\n  - \"Table4\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- She scribbled passcode red7 onto a napkin.\n  - \"red7\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) — Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n- She penciled in task9 on the planner.\n  -

\"SAVE20\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n- He won with move e4 in the opening.\n  - \"e4\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) — Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n- She wore the model ZX14 boots to the party.\n  - \"ZX14\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) — Both Option A and B would accept.\n\n**Now, let's look at some False examples:**\n- The museum opens at 9 on weekdays.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- We met at building C across the quad.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- Rain began at 5 and ended by 8.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- Please deliver to Box A at reception.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- They finished in lane 8 during prelims.\n  -

(no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- She saw 21 stars in the sky. (21: digits only)\n- She read chapter twelve overnight. (no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- The sign read Exit 4 ahead. (4: digit only)\n- I found 9 shells on the beach. (9: digit only)\n- We left at 4 and returned by dusk. (4: digit only)\n- They live on the fourteenth floor. (no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- The heater runs at 60 percent. (60: digits only)\n- She scored ninety points in the final. (no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- He parked by Space A near the door. (A: letter only)\n- The ferry left from Pier Nine. (Nine: letters only)\n- We walked ten miles along the shore. (ten: letters only)\n- The class starts at 8 and ends at 9. (8, 9: digits only)\n- They finished in lane 8 during prelims. (8: digit only)\n- He finished fifth in the race. (no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- The hall is in Block B near the stairs. (B: letter only)\n- Please stack 16 logs by the wall. (16: digits only)\n- They hiked to camp at mile 14. (14: digits only)\n- We took highway 5 after the tolls. (5: digit only)\n- Our meeting starts at 7 a.m. sharp.

(20: digits only)\n\nNow, let's test the two options:\n\nOption A requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits. But we have True examples like \"red7\", \"doc3\", \"x1\", \"set3\", \"e4\", \"bin42a\", \"task9\", \"2A\", which do not start with uppercase letters or do not end with digits. So Option A cannot be correct.\n\nOption B requires the token to have at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run. All True examples have such a token (e.g., F5, River9, red7, bin42a, 2A, etc.), and all False examples lack such a token (they have only digits, only letters, or no such token at all).\n\nTherefore, Option B is correct.\n\nJSON answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Fits both.\n- \"He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\"\n  - \"size10a\" is the token. Starts with lowercase, ends with lowercase. Fits A, not B.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n- \"Rain began at 5 and ended by 8.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit in a single run.\n- \"The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit.\n- \"Press the red button to reset.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit.\n- \"Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying.\"\n  - \"12\" is digits only.\n- \"The match ends at 0 to 0 if tied.\"\n  - \"0\" is digits only.\n- \"He finished fifth in the race.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit.\n- \"Her office is on floor two.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit.\n- \"Please wait in room 12 by the stairwell.\"\n  - \"12\" is digits only.\n- \"He drew five cards from the deck.\"\n  - No token with both letter and digit.\n- \"She saw 21 stars in the sky.\"\n  - \"21\" is digits only.\n- \"He bought 350 apples at the market.\"\n  - \"350\" is digits only.\n\nSo, Option A is satisfied by all True examples and not by any False examples. Option B is not satisfied by many True examples (e.g., \"task9\", \"h3\", \"buoy12B\", \"e4\", \"ch9\", \"A2C\", \"C3PO\", \"r12\", \"size10a\"), so Option B is too restrictive.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

The letter was addressed to PO Box.\n    - \"PO\" (letters only), \"Box\" (letters only).\n\n### Analysis\n\n- Option A requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits. But many True examples do not fit this: \"A2C\", \"set3\", \"Tent3B\", \"fox2\", \"bin42a\", \"2A\", \"ref9a\", \"lot9B\", \"C7E\", \"v2\", \"buoy12B\", \"ch9\", \"X5G\", \"z13\", etc.\n- Option B only requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit, in a single contiguous run. All True examples have such a token, and all False examples do not.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B explains all the True and False examples, while Option A does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\n- Option A: The string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run. (e.g., \"G7\", \"doc3\", \"GradeA2\", \"Room7C\", \"H2O\", \"Table4\", \"PO17\", \"Sector9B\", \"Dock7A\", \"cat B12G\", etc.)\n- Option B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits. (e.g., \"G7\", \"PO17\", \"H23\", but not \"doc3\", \"GradeA2\", \"Room7C\", \"H2O\", \"Table4\", \"Sector9B\", \"Dock7A\", \"cat B12G\", etc.)\n\nNow, let's check the True examples:\n\n- \"Their team rented van E350 for the trip.\" (E350: letter+digits)\n- \"They booked seats in row 14B on the flight.\" (14B: digits+letter)\n- \"The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\" (B12G: letter+digits+letter)\n- \"Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\" (5c: digits+letter)\n- \"He chose brush size S4 for the edges.\" (S4: letter+digit)\n- \"Her coat size is M3 in that brand.\" (M3: letter+digit)\n- \"Her locker

letters+digit+letter)\n- \"She wrote down code X5G for the sample.\" (X5G: letter+digit+letter)\n- \"The recipe calls for GradeA2 milk.\" (GradeA2: letters+letter+digit)\n- \"The new phone is the G7

letter+digit+digit)\n- \"We sat by Table4 during the rehearsal.\" (Table4: letters+digit)\n\nNow, let's check if Option B fits all of these:\n\nOption B requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n\n- \"14B\" (starts with digits, ends with letter) — True example, but doesn't fit Option B.\n- \"5c\" (starts with digit, ends with letter) — True example, doesn't fit Option B.\n- \"mode3\", \"doc3\" (start with lowercase letters, end with digit) — True examples, don't fit Option B.\n- \"GradeA2\", \"Room7C\", \"Dock7A\", \"Sector9B\", \"Figure2A\", \"H2O\", \"X5G\", \"B12G\" — many of these have letters and digits mixed, sometimes ending with a letter, sometimes with a digit.\n\nOption B is too restrictive and does not fit all True examples.\n\nOption A, however, only requires that there is a token (a contiguous run of letters and digits) that contains at least one letter and at least one digit, in any order, anywhere in the token.\n\nAll True examples have such a token.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples to see if Option A would incorrectly accept them:\n\n- \"She scored ninety points in the final.\" (no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- \"We will meet on level 2 of the garage.\" (no such token)\n- \"He ordered size large from the catalog.\" (no such token)\n- \"I saved 100 photos on my phone.\" (no such token)\n- \"The heater runs at 60 percent.\" (no such token)\n- \"The farmer sold 14 hens at market.\" (no such token)\n- \"The label says Grade A on the carton.\" (no such token)\n- \"They finished in lane 8

\"D3\" (letter + digit) — Option A: Yes, Option B: Yes\n\n**False Examples:**\n- They counted 40 chairs in the hall.\n  - \"40\" (digits only)\n- Our seats are in row D and E.\n  - \"D\", \"E\" (letters only)\n- We walked ten miles along the shore.\n  -

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\n- This means any word or token in the sentence that is a mix of letters and digits, in any order, as long as they are together (e.g., \"A1\", \"7b\", \"bin42a\", \"G7\", \"PO17\", \"C3PO\", \"SAVE20\", etc.).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n- This means the token must start with an uppercase letter and end with digits (e.g., \"A1\", \"G7\", \"PO17\", but not \"7b\", \"bin42a\", \"C3PO\", \"SAVE20\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the True examples for tokens that fit each rule:\n\n- \"The plane waited on runway R5 before takeoff.\" (\"R5\": letter+digit, fits both A and B)\n- \"He chose brush size S4 for the edges.\" (\"S4\": letter+digit, fits both A and B)\n- \"Her playlist included song set3 for practice.\" (\"set3\": letters+digit, all lowercase, fits A but not B)\n- \"The keypad flashed code

not B since it doesn't end with digits)\n- \"The label on the jar reads Lot7C.\" (\"Lot7C\": letters+digit+letter, fits A, not B)\n- \"Press F5 to refresh the screen.\" (\"F5\": letter+digit, fits both A and B)\n- \"He set variable x1 to zero.\" (\"x1\": lowercase letter+digit, fits A, not B)\n- \"I scribbled ref9a in the corner.\" (\"ref9a\": letters+digit+letter, all lowercase, fits A, not B)\n- \"The lighthouse keeper patrols Sector9B nightly.\" (\"Sector9B\": letters+digit+letter, fits A, not B)\n- \"He chose channel ch9 for the game.\" (\"ch9\": letters+digit, all lowercase, fits A,

letter+digit, fits both A and B)\n- \"The invoice references PO17 for shipping.\" (\"PO17\": letters+digits, fits both A and B)\n\nNow, let's check the False examples for tokens that might fit either rule:\n- \"The farmer sold 14 hens at market.\" (\"14\": digits only, fits neither)\n- \"They ordered combo number 3 at noon.\" (\"3\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"They finished in lane 8 during prelims.\" (\"8\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"They live on the fourteenth floor.\" (no alphanumeric token, fits neither)\n- \"Our test was on page ten of the guide.\" (no alphanumeric token, fits neither)\n- \"I found 9 shells on the beach.\" (\"9\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"We parked near the alley after sunset.\" (no alphanumeric token, fits neither)\n- \"We rented row E for the show.\" (\"E\": letter only, fits neither)\n- \"Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.\" (\"30\", \"350\": digits only, fits neither)\n- \"The child turned 6 this spring.\" (\"6\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"Dinner begins at 6 o'clock in the hall.\" (\"6\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"I saw 4 birds circle the pier.\" (\"4\": digit only, fits neither)\n- \"He wrote the date 2021 on the

\"She read chapter twelve overnight.\" (no alphanumeric token, fits neither)\n- \"He bought 350 apples at the market.\" (\"350\": digits only, fits neither)\n- \"The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\" (no alphanumeric token, fits neither)\n- \"We looked at plan A and chose it.\" (\"A\": letter only, fits neither)\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\"He parked by Space A near the door.\"\n- \"Space A\": \"A\" is a single letter, not alphanumeric, so fits neither rule.\n\nNow, let's compare the rules:\n\nOption A is satisfied by any token that has at least one letter and at least one digit, in any order, in a single contiguous run. This matches all the True examples, including those with lowercase letters, those that start with digits, and those that end with letters.\n\nOption B is more restrictive: it requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits. This would exclude \"7b\", \"bin42a\", \"ref9a\", \"ch9\", \"n7\", \"k9\", \"task9\", \"lot9B\", \"River9\", \"A2C\", \"C3PO\", etc., all of which are marked True.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Option B does not fit, Option A does.\n\n3. True: The text references Figure2A in the appendix.\n   - \"Figure2A\" contains both letters and digits, but ends with a letter. Option B does not fit, Option A does.\n\n4. True: The old camera model X100 still works.\n   - \"X100\" starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits, so both Option A and B fit here.\n\n5. True: The coupon code SAVE20 worked online.\n   - \"SAVE20\" starts with uppercase and ends with digits, so both fit.\n\n6. True: Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.\n   - \"H2O\" starts with uppercase, has a digit, ends with a letter. Option B does not fit, Option A does.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1.

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n\nLet's check some True examples:\n\n- \"He bought the Nikon D3 last spring.\"  \n  Token: \"D3\" (letter + digit, contiguous, but does not start with uppercase and end with digits only, as \"D3\" is just two characters, but it does start with uppercase and ends with digit.)\n\n- \"The recipe calls for GradeA2 milk.\"  \n  Token: \"A2\" (letter + digit, contiguous, starts with uppercase, ends with digit.)\n\n- \"The plane waited on runway R5 before takeoff.\"  \n  Token: \"R5\" (letter + digit, contiguous, starts with uppercase, ends with digit.)\n\n- \"She penciled in task9 on the planner.\"  \n  Token: \"task9\" (lowercase letters + digit, does not start with uppercase, but is a contiguous run of letters and digits.)\n\n- \"He won with move e4 in the opening.\"  \n  Token: \"e4\" (lowercase letter + digit, does not start with uppercase.)\n\n- \"The label on the jar reads Lot7C.\"  \n  Token: \"Lot7C\" (starts with uppercase, has digits and letters, ends with uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"Set the thermostat to mode3 for eco settings.\"  \n  Token: \"mode3\" (lowercase letters + digit, does not start with uppercase.)\n\n- \"The gallery opened Room7C for the exhibit.\"  \n  Token: \"Room7C\" (starts with uppercase, has digit, ends with uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"She scribbled passcode red7 onto a napkin.\"  \n  Token: \"red7\" (lowercase letters + digit, does not start with uppercase.)\n\n- \"The concert is in Hall 3B near the entrance.\"  \n  Token: \"3B\" (digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"We hiked along path P3 to the lake.\"  \n  Token: \"P3\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\"  \n  Token: \"C3PO\" (uppercase letter + digit + uppercase letters.)\n\n- \"Meet me by GateB12 near the fountain.\"  \n  Token: \"B12\" (uppercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"The kids loved playing on Platform9 at the park.\"  \n  Token: \"Platform9\" (uppercase letter + lowercase letters + digit.)\n\n- \"He parked beside BuildingA2 just before noon.\"  \n  Token: \"A2\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"He repaired drone A2C with spare parts.\"  \n  Token: \"A2C\" (uppercase letter + digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"The cargo was tagged lot9B in the manifest.\"  \n  Token: \"lot9B\" (lowercase letters + digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"They landed at Gate32B just after dawn.\"  \n  Token: \"32B\" (digits + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"We crossed checkpoint z13 at sunset.\"  \n  Token: \"z13\" (lowercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"I folded the note into envelope C4.\"  \n  Token: \"C4\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\"  \n  Token: \"3V\" (digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"We found trail marker R12 near the bend.\"  \n  Token: \"R12\" (uppercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"The coupon code SAVE20 worked online.\"  \n  Token: \"SAVE20\" (uppercase letters + digits.)\n\n- \"The shortcut is on page A3 of the manual.\"  \n  Token: \"A3\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"The text references Figure2A in the appendix.\"  \n  Token: \"Figure2A\" (uppercase letter + lowercase letters + digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"We rented UnitB7 facing the courtyard.\"  \n  Token: \"B7\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"Look for bin42a in the storage room.\"  \n  Token: \"bin42a\" (lowercase letters + digits + lowercase letter.)\n\n- \"Please stand at Dock7A until called.\"  \n  Token: \"7A\" (digit + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"Cut along line A10 on the template.\"  \n  Token: \"A10\" (uppercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"We sailed past buoy12B near the harbor.\"  \n  Token: \"12B\" (digits + uppercase letter.)\n\n- \"She moved to BlockA7 last month.\"  \n  Token: \"A7\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\n- \"The old camera model X100 still works.\"  \n  Token: \"X100\" (uppercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"The invoice references PO17 for shipping.\"  \n  Token: \"PO17\" (uppercase letters + digits.)\n\n- \"They parked at level L10 in the garage.\"  \n  Token: \"L10\" (uppercase letter + digits.)\n\n- \"She filed claim id6 with the clerk.\"  \n  Token: \"id6\" (lowercase letters + digit.)\n\n- \"He brewed a pot of T2 tea in the morning.\"  \n  Token: \"T2\" (uppercase letter + digit.)\n\nSo, in the True examples, the alphanumeric token can be:\n- All uppercase, all lowercase, or mixed case.\n- Can start with a letter or a digit.\n- Can end with a letter or a digit.\n- The only requirement is that the token contains at least one letter and at least one digit, in a single contiguous run.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples:\n\n- \"The code was lost during the transfer.\"  \n  No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"Turn to chapter 4 and read aloud.\"  \n  \"4\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"The team scored 3 goals in the match.\"  \n  \"3\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying.\"  \n  \"12\" is just digits.\n\n- \"She read chapter twelve overnight.\"  \n  \"twelve\" is just letters.\n\n- \"The match ends at 0 to 0 if tied.\"  \n  \"0\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"The village has 300 residents in total.\"  \n  \"300\" is just digits.\n\n- \"The ferry left from Pier Nine.\"  \n  \"Nine\" is just letters.\n\n- \"The child turned 6 this spring.\"  \n  \"6\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"We left at 4 and returned by dusk.\"  \n  \"4\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"He finished fifth in the race.\"  \n  \"fifth\" is just letters.\n\n- \"I saw 1 comet through the telescope.\"  \n  \"1\" is just a digit.\n\n- \"She read 12 pages and took a break.\"  \n  \"12\" is just digits.\n\n- \"The key is in drawer 2 of the desk.\"  \n  \"2\" is just a digit.\n\nSo, the False examples do not have any token with both a letter and a digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nNow, let's check Option B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n\nBut we have True examples like:\n- \"She penciled in task9 on the planner.\" (\"task9\" starts with lowercase)\n- \"He won with move e4 in the opening.\" (\"e4\" starts with lowercase)\n- \"She scribbled passcode red7 onto a napkin.\" (\"red7\" starts with lowercase)\n- \"Look for bin42a in the storage room.\" (\"bin42a\" starts with lowercase, ends with lowercase)\n- \"The concert is in Hall 3B near the entrance.\" (\"3B\" starts with digit)\n- \"We crossed checkpoint z13 at sunset.\" (\"z13\" starts with lowercase)\n- \"Please stand at Dock7A until called.\" (\"7A\" starts with digit)\n- \"We sailed past buoy12B near the harbor.\" (\"12B\" starts with digit)\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\" (\"C3PO\" ends with letters)\n\nSo Option B is too restrictive and does not fit the True examples.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nJSON

Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"bin42a\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with letter.  \n  - Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"size10a\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with letter.  \n  - Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"mode3\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit.  \n  - Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"doc3\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit.  \n  - Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"id6\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit.  \n  - Should be False, but is True in the examples.\n\n- \"r12\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit.  \n  -

True: We sat by Table4 during the rehearsal.\n   - \"Table4\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n2. True: He set variable x1 to zero.\n   - \"x1\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Fits B, not A.\n\n3. True: Power the device with 3V batteries only.\n   - \"3V\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with digit, ends with uppercase. Fits B, not A.\n\n4. True: She scored an A1 on the driving test.\n   - \"A1\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n5. True: She wore the model ZX14 boots to the party.\n   - \"ZX14\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digits. Fits both A and B.\n\n6. True: Their team rented van E350 for the trip.\n   - \"E350\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digits. Fits both A and B.\n\n7. True: Her password started with h3 and symbols.\n   - \"h3\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Fits B, not A.\n\n8. True: Press F5 to refresh the screen.\n   - \"F5\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n9. True: The old camera model X100 still works.\n   - \"X100\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with uppercase, ends with digits. Fits both A and B.\n\n10. True: The locker combo started with n7 today.\n    - \"n7\" is an alphanumeric token, starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Fits B, not A.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. False: The sign read Exit 4 ahead.\n   - \"Exit\" and \"4\" are separate tokens, not a single alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n2. False: He bought 350 apples at the market.\n   - \"350\" is digits only.\n\n3. False: We rented row E for the show.\n   - \"E\" is a letter only.\n\n4. False: The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n5. False: I found 9 shells on the beach.\n   - \"9\" is digit only.\n\n6. False: The cashier gave back 8 coins.\n   - \"8\" is digit only.\n\n7. False: She bought size S at the boutique.\n   - \"S\" is letter only.\n\n8. False: He finished fifth in the race.\n   - \"fifth\" is letters only.\n\nNow, let's test the rules:\n\n- Option A requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits. But \"x1\", \"h3\", \"n7\", \"3V\" are all True but do not start with uppercase and end with digits. So Option A is too restrictive.\n- Option B requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.

True: I saved the draft as doc3 before closing.\n    - \"doc3\" — starts with d, so B fails. A fits.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples to see if they would be accepted by either rule:\n\n1. False: The hall is in Block B near the stairs.\n   - \"Block B\" — no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit, so both A and B reject.\n2. False: Call me at 555 0199 if plans change.\n   - \"555\", \"0199\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n3. False: The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\n   - \"nine\" — letters only, both rules reject.\n4. False: We traveled 200 miles under clear skies.\n   - \"200\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n5.

False: I saw 1 comet through the telescope.\n   - \"1\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n8. False: Dinner begins at 6 o'clock in the hall.\n   - \"6\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n9. False: I saw 4 birds circle the pier.\n   - \"4\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n10. False: We rented row E for the show.\n    - \"E\" — letter only, both rules reject.\n11.

False: Her flight boards at Gate A soon.\n    - \"A\" — letter only, both rules reject.\n16. False: We drove along Route 66 at dusk.\n    - \"66\" — digits only, both rules reject.\n17. False: Send the parcel to Box C at noon.\n    - \"C\" — letter only, both rules reject.\n\nNow, let's check some edge cases:\n\n- True: He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\n  - \"10a\" — starts with digit, ends with letter, so B fails. A fits.\n- True: The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\n  - \"B12G\" — ends with letter, so B fails. A fits.\n- True: The cargo was tagged lot9B in the manifest.\n  - \"9B\" — starts with digit, ends with letter, so B fails. A fits.\n- True: The text references Figure2A in the appendix.\n  - \"2A\" — starts with digit, ends with letter, so B fails. A fits.\n\nTherefore, Option B is too restrictive, as it requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits, but there are many True examples where the token starts with a digit, or ends with a letter, or is lowercase.\n\nOption A, which only requires a contiguous alphanumeric token with at least one letter and at least one digit, fits all True examples and rejects all False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

True: Her playlist included song set3 for practice.\n   - \"set3\" (starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit) → Option A would not accept (doesn't start with uppercase), Option B would accept (contains both letter and digit).\n\n2. True: Their squad took route B52 across the field.\n   - \"B52\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digits) → Option A accepts, Option B accepts.\n\n3. True: I folded the note into envelope C4.\n   - \"C4\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → Option A accepts, Option B accepts.\n\n4. True: The keypad flashed code 7b on error.\n   - \"7b\" (starts with digit, ends with letter) → Option A does not accept, Option B accepts.\n\n5. True: Set the thermostat to mode3 for eco settings.\n   - \"mode3\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → Option A does not accept, Option B accepts.\n\n6. True: The label on the jar reads Lot7C.\n   - \"Lot7C\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase) → Option A does not accept, Option B accepts.\n\n7. True: Attach tag R4C to the crate.\n   - \"R4C\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase) → Option A does not accept, Option B accepts.\n\n8. True: The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\n   - \"C3PO\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase) → Option A does not accept, Option B accepts.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. False: He filled out form C before lunch.\n   - \"C\" (only letter, no digit) → Both A and B reject.\n\n2. False: The cashier gave back 8 coins.\n   - \"8\" (only digit) → Both A and B reject.\n\n3.

False: She bought size S at the boutique.\n   - \"S\" (only letter) → Both A and B reject.\n\nSo, Option B is more general: it accepts any alphanumeric token with at least one letter and at least one digit, regardless of order or case. Option A is more restrictive: it requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits.\n\nBut many True examples (e.g., \"set3\", \"mode3\", \"7b\", \"Lot7C\", \"R4C\", \"C3PO\") would not be accepted by Option A, because they don't start with uppercase and end with digits.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\n- This means any token (word, code, etc.) that is a mix of letters and digits, in any order, as long as they are together (e.g., A21, 2A, ZX14, B19, X5G, etc.).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n- This is more restrictive: the token must start with an uppercase letter and end with digits (e.g., A21, B19, X100, but not 2A, 5c, n7, etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the True examples for counterexamples to Option B:\n\n- \"They ordered part 2A from the catalog.\" (True) — Token is \"2A\", starts with a digit, not an uppercase letter. This would NOT be accepted by Option B.\n- \"He pressed key k9 by mistake.\" (True) — Token is \"k9\", starts with lowercase letter, not uppercase. Not accepted by Option B.\n- \"Upload version v2 to the server tonight.\" (True) — Token is \"v2\", starts with lowercase letter. Not accepted by Option B.\n- \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\" (True) — Token is \"3V\", starts with digit. Not accepted by Option B.\n- \"The locker combo started with n7 today.\" (True) — Token is \"n7\", starts with lowercase letter. Not accepted by Option B.\n- \"Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\" (True) — Token is \"5c\", starts with digit, not uppercase letter. Not accepted by Option B.\n\nAll of these are True, but would be rejected by Option B.\n\nNow, let's check if Option A fits all True examples:\n- All True examples have a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run (e.g., A21, 2A, ZX14, B19, X5G, k9, v2, 3V, n7, 5c, etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n- \"The cashier gave back 8 coins.\" (False) — Only a number, no letter-digit token.\n- \"I saw 4 birds circle the pier.\" (False) — Only a number, no letter-digit token.\n- \"There were 19 candles on the cake.\" (False) — Only a number, no letter-digit token.\n- \"Please deliver to Box A at reception.\" (False) — \"A\" is a letter, but not mixed with a digit.\n- \"We took highway 5 after the tolls.\" (False) — \"5\" is a digit, not mixed with a letter.\n- \"Store opens at 8 on Saturday.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"Bring three bowls and a pot.\" (False) — No alphanumeric token.\n- \"She read chapter twelve overnight.\" (False) — No alphanumeric token.\n- \"The storm left 5 inches of snow.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"I left my coat in locker 18.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"The parcel weighs 4 kg on the scale.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"We rented row E for the show.\" (False) — Only a letter.\n- \"The museum opens at 9 on weekdays.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"We stopped at house number 44 on Elm.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"She saw 21 stars in the sky.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"They finished in lane 8 during prelims.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"Her flight boards at Gate A soon.\" (False) — Only a letter.\n- \"The flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes.\" (False) — Only numbers.\n- \"We will meet on level 2 of the garage.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"They hiked to camp at mile 14.\" (False) — Only a number.\n- \"They live on the fourteenth floor.\" (False) — No alphanumeric token.\n- \"Call me at 555 0199 if plans change.\" (False) — Only numbers.\n- \"We met at building C across the quad.\" (False) — Only a letter.\n- \"She bought size S at the boutique.\" (False) — Only a letter.\n\nNone of the False examples have a token with both a letter and a digit in a single run.\n\nTherefore, Option A fits all the True and False examples, while Option B is too restrictive and does not fit all True examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(no alphanumeric token with both letter and digit)\n- He wrote the date 2021 on the form. (2021: digits only)\n- Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying. (12: digits only)\n- She read 12 pages and took a break. (12: digits only)\n- The flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes. (50, 13: digits only)\n- We stopped at house number 44 on Elm.

It starts with a capital letter, but ends with a letter and a digit. Option A fits, Option B fits.\n- \"He pressed key k9 by mistake.\"\n  - \"k9\" is a token with a letter and a digit.

Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"He set variable x1 to zero.\"\n  - \"x1\" is a token with a letter and a digit. Does not start with uppercase. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\"\n  - \"5c\" is a token with a digit and a letter. Does not start with uppercase. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"He repaired drone A2C with spare parts.\"\n  - \"A2C\" is a token with a letter, digit, letter. Starts with uppercase, ends with a letter. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.\"\n  - \"H2O\" is a token with a letter, digit, letter. Starts with uppercase, ends with a letter. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\"\n  - \"C3PO\" is a token with a letter, digit, letters. Starts with uppercase, ends with a letter. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n- \"The old camera model X100 still works.\"\n  - \"X100\" is a token with a letter and digits. Starts with uppercase, ends with digits. Option A fits, Option B fits.\n\nNow, some False examples:\n- \"The village has 300 residents in total.\"\n  - \"300\" is only digits. Option A and B both reject.\n- \"We looked at plan A and chose it.\"\n  - \"A\" is only a letter. Option A and B both reject.\n- \"Please wait in room 12 by the stairwell.\"\n  - \"12\" is only digits. Option A and B both reject.\n- \"Her office is on floor two.\"\n  - \"two\" is only letters.

Option A and B both reject.\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\"The sign pointed to HallC4 upstairs.\"\n- \"HallC4\" is a token with letters and a digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with a digit. Option A fits, Option B fits.\n\nBut, crucially, many True examples have tokens that do not start with uppercase letters, or do not end with digits. For example, \"k9\", \"task9\", \"f1\", \"id6\", \"x1\", \"5c\", \"A2C\", \"H2O\", \"C3PO\", \"Lot7C\", \"Room7C\", etc.\n\nTherefore, Option B is too restrictive and would not accept many of the True examples.\n\nOption A, which only requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run, fits all the True examples and rejects the False ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\n- This means any word or token in the text that has both letters and digits together, in any order, and possibly more than one of each.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it includes an alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n- This is more restrictive: the token must start with an uppercase letter and end with digits, e.g., \"A10\", \"B52\", \"G7\", etc.\n\nNow, let's look at some True examples and see which rule fits better:\n\n1. True: Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\n   - \"5c\" is a token with a digit and a letter, but it starts with a digit, not an uppercase letter. Option B would not accept this, but Option A would.\n\n2. True: We stayed in Apt4C for the weekend.\n   - \"Apt4C\" has both letters and digits, but does not start with an uppercase letter and end with digits. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n\n3. True: The keypad flashed code 7b on error.\n   - \"7b\" starts with a digit, not an uppercase letter. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n\n4. True: The invoice references PO17 for shipping.\n   - \"PO17\" starts with uppercase letters and ends with digits. Both Option A and B fit.\n\n5. True: The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\n   - \"B12G\" starts with uppercase, has digits, but ends with a letter. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n\n6. True: She scored an A1 on the driving test.\n   - \"A1\" starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both fit.\n\n7. True: The engineer inspected girder G7 for cracks.\n   - \"G7\" starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both fit.\n\n8. True: Her password started with h3 and symbols.\n   - \"h3\" starts with lowercase, not uppercase. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n\n9. True: Power the device with 3V batteries only.\n   - \"3V\" starts with digit, not uppercase. Option A fits, Option B does not.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples to see if they would be incorrectly accepted by either rule:\n\n1. False: He bought 350 apples at the market.\n   - \"350\" is all digits, no letters. Neither rule accepts.\n\n2. False: Set alarm for 7 and sleep early.\n   - \"7\" is all digits. Neither rule accepts.\n\n3. False: The hall is in Block B near the stairs.\n   - \"Block\" and \"B\" are all letters. Neither rule accepts.\n\n4. False: Call me at 555 0199 if plans change.\n   - \"555\", \"0199\" are all digits. Neither rule accepts.\n\n5. False: The bus arrives at stop D next.\n   - \"D\" is all letters. Neither rule accepts.\n\n6. False: The tent is stored in bin 4.\n   - \"4\" is all digits. Neither rule accepts.\n\nSo, Option A fits all True examples and does not incorrectly accept any False examples. Option B is too restrictive and would miss many True examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Option A would accept, Option B would.\n- \"She wrote down code X5G for the sample.\"\n  - \"X5G\": starts with 'X', ends with 'G', not digits. Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n\nNow, some False examples:\n\n- \"Take exit 22 after the bridge.\"\n  - \"22\": only digits, no letters. Option B would not accept.\n- \"The village has 300 residents in total.\"\n  - \"300\": only digits, no letters. Option B would not accept.\n- \"We rented row E for the show.\"\n  - \"E\": only letter, no digit. Option B would not accept.\n\nNow, let's check for counterexamples:\n\n- \"Press F5 to refresh the screen.\"\n  - \"F5\": starts with 'F', ends with digit. Option A would accept, Option B would.\n- \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\"\n  - \"3V\": starts with digit, ends with letter. Option A would not accept, Option B would.\n\nSo, Option A would not accept \"3V\", but it is marked True. Option B would accept it.\n\nAlso, \"i7\" (True) starts with lowercase, not uppercase, so Option A would not accept, but Option B would.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nOption B is the correct rule: the string is accepted when it contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\n\nJSON answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

The new phone is the G7 model.\n   - \"G7\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n2. My laptop runs on i7 hardware without issues.\n   - \"i7\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n3.

The lighthouse keeper patrols Sector9B nightly.\n    - \"Sector9B\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase) → does not fit A, but fits B.\n16. He pressed key k9 by mistake.\n    - \"k9\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n17.

She penciled in task9 on the planner.\n    - \"task9\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n21. The text references Figure2A in the appendix.\n    - \"Figure2A\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase) → does not fit A, but fits B.\n22. He drew card Q4 from the stack.\n    - \"Q4\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n23. She moved to BlockA7 last month.\n    - \"BlockA7\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n24. He won with move e4 in the opening.\n    - \"e4\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n25.

So, neither rule would accept this.\n\nNow, let's compare the rules:\n\n- Option A is too restrictive: it requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits. But many True examples (e.g., \"G10B\", \"h3\", \"size10a\", \"H2O\", \"3B\", \"set3\", \"lot9B\", \"Bay4B\", \"14B\", \"7b\", \"5c\") do not fit this pattern.\n- Option B is more general: it requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run. All True examples have such a token, and all False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

It starts with a capital letter, but ends with a letter, not digits. So, fits A, not B.\n\n2. \"Pour to line B3 on the measuring cup.\"\n   - \"B3\" is a single token with a letter and a digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n3. \"Her badge read ID7 when she checked in.\"\n   - \"ID7\" is a single token with letters and a digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n4. \"He tested build r12 ahead of release.\"\n   - \"r12\" is a single token with a letter and digits. Starts with lowercase, ends with digits. Fits A, not B.\n\n5. \"He won with move e4 in the opening.\"\n   - \"e4\" is a single token with a letter and digit. Starts with lowercase, ends with digit.

Fits A, not B.\n\n7. \"He drew card Q4 from the stack.\"\n   - \"Q4\" is a single token with letter and digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n8. \"He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\"\n   - \"size10a\" is a single token with letters and digits. Starts with lowercase, ends with letter. Fits A, not B.\n\n9. \"Her alias was fox2 and it stuck for years.\"\n   - \"fox2\" is a single token with letters and digit. Starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Fits A, not B.\n\n10. \"The coupon code SAVE20 worked online.\"\n    - \"SAVE20\" is a single token with letters and digits. Starts with uppercase, ends with digits. Fits both A and B.\n\n11. \"The label on the jar reads Lot7C.\"\n    - \"Lot7C\" is a single token with letters and digits. Starts with uppercase, ends with letter. Fits A, not B.\n\n12. \"He pressed key k9 by mistake.\"\n    - \"k9\" is a single token with letter and digit. Starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Fits A, not B.\n\n13. \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\"\n    - \"3V\" is a single token with digit and letter. Starts with digit, not letter. Fits A, not B.\n\n14. \"She tuned the radio to FM2 for the concert.\"\n    - \"FM2\" is a single token with letters and digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\n15. \"She watered plant A9 twice a week.\"\n    - \"A9\" is a single token with letter and digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits both A and B.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. \"Meet me at Gate 5 when you arrive.\"\n   - \"Gate 5\" is two tokens, \"Gate\" and \"5\". No single token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n2. \"Our test was on page ten of the guide.\"\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n3. \"We traveled 200 miles under clear skies.\"\n   - \"200\" is digits only. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n4. \"The meeting is in Building C today.\"\n   - \"Building\" and \"C\" are separate tokens. No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n5. \"Set alarm for 7 and sleep early.\"\n   - \"7\" is digits only. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n6. \"We took highway 5 after the tolls.\"\n   - \"highway\" and \"5\" are separate tokens. No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n7. \"We parked near the alley after sunset.\"\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\n8. \"We met at building C across the quad.\"\n   - \"building\" and \"C\" are separate tokens. No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits both A and B as False.\n\nNow, let's check for counterexamples that would disprove either rule.\n\n- \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\" (\"3V\" starts with digit, not letter, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n- \"He tested build r12 ahead of release.\" (\"r12\" starts with lowercase letter, not uppercase, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n- \"He won with move e4 in the opening.\" (\"e4\" starts with lowercase letter, not uppercase, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n- \"Her alias was fox2 and it stuck for years.\" (\"fox2\" starts with lowercase letter, not uppercase, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n- \"He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\" (\"size10a\" starts with lowercase letter, ends with letter, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n- \"The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\" (\"B12G\" ends with letter, not digit, but is True. So B is not correct.)\n\nTherefore, Option B is too restrictive and does not fit all True examples.\n\nOption A, however, fits all True examples: any token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

\"size10a\" (letters+digits+letter) → True\n\nAll of these have a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- \"B3\" — starts with uppercase, ends with digit → Yes\n- \"bin42a\" — starts with lowercase, ends with letter → No\n- \"R12\" — starts with uppercase, ends with digit → Yes\n- \"Gate32B\" — starts with uppercase, ends

Not accepted by either rule.\n- \"We traveled 200 miles under clear skies.\"\n  - 200: Only digits. Not accepted by either rule.\n- \"Her flight boards at Gate A soon.\"\n  - A: Only letter. Not accepted by either rule.\n- \"He parked by Space A near the door.\"\n  - A: Only letter. Not accepted by either rule.\n- \"They waited in section 7 near the stage.\"\n  - 7: Only digit. Not accepted by either rule.\n- \"We walked ten miles along the shore.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"Our test was on page ten of the guide.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"We rented row E for the show.\"\n  - E: Only letter.\n- \"She read 12 pages and took a break.\"\n  - 12: Only digits.\n- \"He ordered size large from the catalog.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"The ferry left from Pier Nine.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"The heater runs at 60 percent.\"\n  - 60: Only digits.\n- \"There were 19 candles on the cake.\"\n  - 19: Only digits.\n- \"Her codename was never spoken aloud.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"We met at building C across the quad.\"\n  - C: Only letter.\n- \"He circled item B on the form.\"\n  - B: Only letter.\n- \"Press the red button to reset.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n- \"The village has 300 residents in total.\"\n  - 300: Only digits.\n- \"Please stack 16 logs by the wall.\"\n  - 16: Only digits.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Option A would reject tokens like \"2A\", \"set3\", \"func2\", \"e4\", \"id6\", \"red7\", \"fox2\", \"z13\", which are all True examples, because they do not start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n- Option B would accept any token that contains at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run, regardless of order or case. This fits all the True examples and rejects all the False examples.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option B is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

True: She scribbled passcode red7 onto a napkin.\n   - \"red7\" is a token with both letters and a digit, but it does not start with an uppercase letter nor end with digits only (since \"red\" is lowercase).\n   - Fits A, not B.\n\n2. True: She waved from Pier9A when we arrived.\n   - \"Pier9A\" has both letters and a digit, but ends with a letter, not digits.\n   - Fits A, not B.\n\n3.

True: The sign pointed to HallC4 upstairs.\n   - \"HallC4\" has both letters and a digit, but ends with a digit, and starts with uppercase, but the digit is not at the end of the token.\n   - Fits A, but B is too restrictive.\n\n6. True: The old camera model X100 still works.\n   - \"X100\" starts with uppercase, ends with digits.\n   - Fits both A and B.\n\n7. True: Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.\n   - \"H2O\" is uppercase, digit, uppercase.\n   - Does not end with digits, so B fails.\n   - Fits A.\n\n8. True: The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\n   - \"C3PO\" is uppercase, digit, uppercase, uppercase.\n   - Does not end with digits, so B fails.\n   - Fits A.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. False: The report was filed on page 3 of the binder.\n   - \"3\" is just a digit, not a mix.\n   - Fits A and B as False.\n\n2. False: They reserved table C near the window.\n   - \"C\" is just a letter.\n   - Fits A and B as False.\n\n3. False: I left my coat in locker 18.\n   - \"18\" is just digits.\n   - Fits A and B as False.\n\n4. False: He parked by Space A near the door.\n   - \"A\" is just a letter.\n   - Fits A and B as False.\n\nNow, let's check for counterexamples that would break either rule.\n\n- Are there any True examples where the token does NOT start with an uppercase letter? Yes: \"red7\", \"id6\", \"func2\", \"task9\", \"r12\".\n- Are there any True examples where the token does NOT end with digits? Yes: \"H2O\", \"C3PO\", \"Pier9A\", \"J7\", \"M31\", \"M3\", \"G10B\", \"lotC3\", \"buoy12B\", \"Room7C\", \"GateB12\".\n\nTherefore, Option B is too restrictive and does not fit the True examples.\n\nOption A, which only requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run, fits all the True examples and excludes the False ones.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

So Option B would not accept this, but Option A would.\n\n- He bought the Nikon D3 last spring.\n  - D3: contains both letter and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both A and B would accept.\n\n- Look for bin42a in the storage room.\n  - bin42a: contains both letters and digits, but does not start with uppercase or end with digits. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- Pour to line B3 on the measuring cup.\n  - B3: both letter and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both A and B would accept.\n\n- We stayed in Apt4C for the weekend.\n  - Apt4C: both letters and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- Deliver crate to Bay4B by noon.\n  - Bay4B: both letters and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- The keypad flashed code 7b on error.\n  - 7b: both digit and letter, starts with digit, ends with letter. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- She highlighted section s12 in the report.\n  - s12: both letter and digits, starts with lowercase, ends with digits. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- He set variable x1 to zero.\n  - x1: both letter and digit, starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- He tested build r12 ahead of release.\n  - r12: both letter and digits, starts with lowercase, ends with digits. Option A would accept, Option B would not.\n\n- The sign pointed to HallC4 upstairs.\n  - HallC4: both letters and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both A and B would accept.\n\n- Their canoe named River9 had a cracked hull.\n  - River9: both letters and digit, starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both A and B would accept.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- I saved 100 photos on my phone.\n  - 100: only digits, no letters. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- She watered Plant A each morning.\n  - A: only letter, no digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- We walked ten miles along the shore.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- He wrote the date 2021 on the form.\n  - 2021: only digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- I left my coat in locker 18.\n  - 18: only digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- He ordered size large from the catalog.\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- We drove along Route 66 at dusk.\n  - 66: only digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying.\n  - 12: only digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- The report was filed on page 3 of the binder.\n  - 3: only digit. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- I found 9 shells on the beach.\n  - 9: only digit. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- She saw 21 stars in the sky.\n  - 21: only digits. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\n- Store opens at 8 on Saturday.\n  - 8: only digit. Neither A nor B would accept.\n\nSo, Option A accepts all True examples and rejects all False examples. Option B only accepts a subset of the True examples (those that start with uppercase and end with digits), but not all (e.g., bin42a, s12, x1, r12, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Token: M3 (letter + digit, contiguous)  \n  - Starts with uppercase, ends with digit (fits both A and B)\n\n- Their badge showed group G10B.  \n  - Token: G10B (letter + digit + letter, contiguous)  \n  -

Token: k9 (lowercase letter + digit, contiguous)  \n  - Starts with lowercase, ends with digit (fits A, not B)\n\n- The mural is in Gallery3 behind the stairs.  \n  - Token: Gallery3 (letters + digit, contiguous)  \n  -

Starts with uppercase, ends with digit (fits both A and B)\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- Bring three bowls and a pot.  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- The farmer sold 14 hens at market.  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- The letter was addressed to PO Box.  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- The museum opens at 9 on weekdays.  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- I saw 4 birds circle the pier.  \n  -

So Option B is too restrictive.\n\nOption A fits all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The correct rule is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(n7: starts with lowercase, ends with digit)\n- We camped at campsite C7E before dawn. (C7E: starts with uppercase, ends with letter)\n- She wrote down code X5G for the sample.

(no token with both letter and digit)\n- The plane departs at 10 tomorrow. (10: digits only)\n- The ferry left from Pier Nine. (Nine: letters only)\n- Dinner begins at 6 o'clock in the hall.

text:\n\n\"Our ferry left from Pier2 during the fog.\"  \nToken: Pier2 (starts with uppercase, ends with digit)  \nFits A, fits B.\n\nBut the answer was False. This is a key counterexample.\n\nBut let's look at the other True examples: \"Pier9A\" is True, \"Pier2\" is False.  \n\"Pier9A\" (Pier + digit + uppercase letter)  \n\"Pier2\" (Pier + digit)\n\nSo, the rule must require at least one letter and at least one digit in a single token, but not just a letter(s) followed by a digit. But \"P3\" is True, \"Pier2\" is False.\n\nSo, \"P3\" (uppercase letter + digit) is True, \"Pier2\" (uppercase letters + digit) is False.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that the token must have at least one letter and at least one digit, but not if the token is a word followed by a digit (i.e., more than one letter before the digit). But \"mode3\" is True, \"set3\" is True, \"build r12\" is True, \"size10a\" is True.\n\nBut \"Pier2\" is False, \"Pier9A\" is True.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: the token must have at least one letter and at least one digit, and the token must not end with a digit (i.e., must end with a letter or have a letter after the digit). But \"P3\" is True, \"A1\" is True, \"G7\" is True, \"B19\" is True, \"r12\" is True.\n\nBut \"Pier2\" is False, \"Pier9A\" is True.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: the token must have at least one letter and at least one digit, and if the token is a word followed by a digit, it must be a single letter before the digit, not a word.\n\nBut \"mode3\" is True, \"set3\" is True, \"build r12\" is True.\n\nBut \"Pier2\" is False.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: the token must have at least one letter and at least one digit, and if the token is a word followed by a digit, the word must not be a common noun (like \"Pier\"), but that's not a generalizable rule.\n\nGiven all this, Option A fits almost all the True examples, and Option B is too restrictive (must start with uppercase and end with digits), which is not the case for many True examples.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nJSON: {\"answer\":\"A\"}",

It does not start with an uppercase letter, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n- \"He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\"\n  - \"size10a\" contains both letters and digits in a single contiguous run. It does not start with an uppercase letter, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n- \"He repaired drone A2C with spare parts.\"\n  - \"A2C\" contains both letters and digits in a single contiguous run. It starts with an uppercase letter, but ends with a letter, not digits, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n- \"Their badge showed group G10B.\"\n  - \"G10B\" contains both letters and digits in a single contiguous run. Starts with uppercase, ends with letter, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n- \"Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\"\n  - \"5c\" contains both letters and digits in a single contiguous run. Starts with digit, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n\nNow, some False examples:\n\n- \"He wrote the date 2021 on the form.\"\n  - \"2021\" is only digits, no letters, so Option A would not accept it, nor would Option B.\n- \"Send the parcel to Box C at noon.\"\n  - \"Box C\" is two tokens, \"Box\" and \"C\", neither is alphanumeric with both letters and digits, so both options would not accept.\n- \"They ordered combo number 3 at noon.\"\n  - \"3\" is only digits, so both options would not accept.\n\nNow, let's look at Option B's requirements: token starts with uppercase letter and ends with digits.\n\n- \"Classroom C12 is reserved today.\"\n  - \"C12\" starts with uppercase, ends with digits. This fits Option B.\n- \"The new phone is the G7 model.\"\n  - \"G7\" starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Fits Option B.\n- \"She wrote down code X5G for the sample.\"\n  - \"X5G\" starts with uppercase, ends with letter, so Option B would not accept, but Option A would.\n\nBut, many True examples do not start with uppercase and end with digits, e.g., \"size10a\", \"lotC3\", \"A2C\", \"X5G\", \"fox2\", \"bin42a\", \"doc3\", \"n7\", \"h3\", \"f1\", \"mode3\", etc.\n\nTherefore, Option A is more general and fits all True examples: any token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nOption B is too restrictive and would not accept many True examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

True: She filed claim id6 with the clerk.\n   - \"id6\" is a token with both letters and digits, but does not start with an uppercase letter nor end with digits only (the whole token is \"id6\").\n2. True: They landed at Gate32B just after dawn.\n   - \"Gate32B\" has both letters and digits, but does not end with digits (ends with \"B\").\n3. True: She wrote down code X5G for the sample.\n   - \"X5G\" has both letters and digits, but does not end with digits.\n4. True: The coupon code SAVE20 worked online.\n   - \"SAVE20\" starts with uppercase, ends with digits.\n5. True: Her coat size is M3 in that brand.\n   - \"M3\" has both letters and digits, starts with uppercase, ends with digit.\n6. True: Set the thermostat to mode3 for eco settings.\n   - \"mode3\" has both letters and digits, starts with lowercase, ends with digit.\n7. True: Their kiosk is booth B19 by the door.\n   - \"B19\" starts with uppercase, ends with digits.\n8. True: He adjusted lens f1 for low light.\n   - \"f1\" starts with lowercase, ends with digit.\n9. True: The shortcut is on page A3 of the manual.\n   - \"A3\" starts with uppercase, ends with digit.\n10. True: He fixed the bug in func2 before lunch.\n    - \"func2\" starts with lowercase, ends with digit.\n11. True: We sat by Table4 during the rehearsal.\n    - \"Table4\" starts with uppercase, ends with digit.\n12. True: Please stand at Dock7A until called.\n    - \"Dock7A\" starts with uppercase, ends with letter.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n1. False: The meeting is in Building C today.\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n2. False: Seven sparrows drifted quietly over the bay.\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n3. False: He filled out form C before lunch.\n   - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n4. False: The sign read Exit 4 ahead.\n   - \"Exit 4\" is two tokens, not a single token with both letter and digit.\n5. False: Please wait in room 12 by the stairwell.\n   - \"room 12\" is two tokens.\n\nNow, let's test the rules:\n\nOption A: Accepts any token with at least one letter and at least one digit, regardless of order or case.\nOption B: Only accepts tokens that start with uppercase and end with digits.\n\nLet's check \"id6\" (True): starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Option B would not accept this, but Option A would.\n\nLet's check \"mode3\" (True): starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Option B would not accept this, but Option A would.\n\nLet's check \"Dock7A\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with letter. Option B would not accept this, but Option A would.\n\nLet's check \"X5G\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with letter.

False: They counted 40 chairs in the hall.\n    - \"40\" (no letter)\n\n15. False: Her codename was never spoken aloud.\n    - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n16. False: He wrote the date 2021 on the form.\n    - \"2021\" (no letter)\n\n17. False: We traveled 200 miles under clear skies.\n    - \"200\" (no letter)\n\n18.

Option B, however, fails for many True cases where the token starts with a lowercase letter or ends with a letter (e.g., \"bin42a\", \"A2C\", \"H2O\", \"Room7C\", etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

True: Attach tag R4C to the crate.\n    - \"R4C\" (starts with uppercase, ends with letter) → fits A, not B.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- False: I paid 20 dollars for the ticket.\n  - \"20\" (digits only) → fits neither A nor B.\n\n- False: Our seats are in row D and E.\n  - \"D\", \"E\" (letters only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The storm left 5 inches of snow.\n  - \"5\" (digits only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The report was filed on page 3 of the binder.\n  - \"3\" (digits only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: She watered Plant A each morning.\n  - \"A\" (letter only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The bus arrives at stop D next.\n  - \"D\" (letter only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The tent is stored in bin 4.\n  - \"4\" (digit only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The bill came to $75 after tax.\n  - \"$75\" (symbol + digits) → fits neither.\n\n- False: The sign read Exit 4 ahead.\n  - \"4\" (digit only) → fits neither.\n\n- False: I saw 4 birds circle the pier.\n  - \"4\" (digit only) → fits neither.\n\nSo, Option A is more general: it allows any alphanumeric token with at least one letter and at least one digit, regardless of order or case. Option B is more restrictive: it requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n\nBut many True examples (e.g., \"A2C\", \"B12G\", \"task9\", \"3B\", \"red7\", \"k9\", \"R4C\") do not end with digits or do not start with uppercase letters, so Option B would incorrectly classify them as False.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

It does not start with an uppercase letter, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n\n- \"He brewed a pot of T2 tea in the morning.\"\n  - \"T2\" is a contiguous run with a letter and a digit. It starts with an uppercase letter and ends with a digit, so both A and B would accept it.\n\n- \"I scribbled ref9a in the corner.\"\n  - \"ref9a\" is a contiguous run with letters and a digit. It does not start with an uppercase letter nor end with digits, so Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\"\n  - \"C3PO\" is a contiguous run with letters and digits. It starts with an uppercase letter, but ends with a letter, not digits. Option B would not accept it, but Option A would.\n\n- \"He drew card Q4 from the stack.\"\n  - \"Q4\" is a contiguous run with a letter and a digit. Starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Both A and B would accept.\n\n- \"The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\"\n  - \"B12G\" is a contiguous run with letters and digits. Starts with uppercase, ends with letter. Option B would not accept, Option A would.\n\nNow, some False examples:\n\n- \"Turn to chapter 4 and read aloud.\"\n  - \"4\" is just a digit, not a mix of letter and digit. Both A and B would reject.\n\n- \"The storm left 5 inches of snow.\"\n  - \"5\" is just a digit. Both A and B would reject.\n\n- \"He ordered size large from the catalog.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token. Both A and B would reject.\n\n- \"We stopped at house number 44 on Elm.\"\n  - \"44\" is just digits. Both A and B would reject.\n\n- \"He circled item B on the form.\"\n  - \"B\" is just a letter. Both A and B would reject.\n\n- \"The tent is stored in bin 4.\"\n  - \"4\" is just a digit. Both A and B would reject.\n\nSo, Option A is more general and fits all the True examples, while Option B is too restrictive and would miss many True examples (such as \"red7\", \"ref9a\", \"C3PO\", \"B12G\", etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

\"TeamX1\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- We sat by Table4 during the rehearsal.  \n  - \"Table4\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- The old camera model X100 still works.  \n  -

\"BuildingA2\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- The map shows fork F9 just past the bridge.  \n  - \"F9\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- Park near spot J7 if available.  \n  - \"J7\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- Their squad took route B52 across the field.  \n  - \"B52\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- We sailed past buoy12B near the harbor.  \n  - \"buoy12B\" (starts with lowercase, ends with uppercase) → fits B, not A.\n- Upload version v2 to the server tonight.  \n  - \"v2\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- I saved the draft as doc3 before closing.  \n  - \"doc3\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- Set the thermostat to mode3 for eco settings.  \n  - \"mode3\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- He pressed key k9 by mistake.  \n  - \"k9\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- Her alias was fox2 and it stuck for years.  \n  - \"fox2\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- He brewed a pot of T2 tea in the morning.  \n  - \"T2\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n- Her password started with h3 and symbols.  \n  - \"h3\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n- The keypad flashed code 7b on error.  \n  - \"7b\" (starts with digit, ends with letter) → fits B, not A.\n- He adjusted lens f1 for low light.  \n  - \"f1\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) → fits B, not A.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- The tent is stored in bin 4.  \n  - \"bin 4\" (space between, not a single token)\n- Send the parcel to Box C at noon.  \n  - \"Box C\" (space between, not a single token)\n- The letter was addressed to PO Box.  \n  - \"PO Box\" (space between, not a single token)\n- Please wait in room 12 by the stairwell.  \n  - \"room 12\" (space between, not a single token)\n- I paid 20 dollars for the ticket.  \n  - \"20\" (digits only)\n- Our meeting starts at 7 a.m. sharp.  \n  - \"7\" (digits only)\n- Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  \n  -

\"14\" (digits only)\n- The code was lost during the transfer.  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nHer badge read ID7 when she checked in.\n\n- \"ID7\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit) → fits A and B.\n\nBut, crucially, many True examples have tokens like \"doc3\", \"fox2\", \"v2\", \"n7\", \"h3\", \"7b\", \"buoy12B\", which do NOT start with uppercase and end with digit, but do have at least one letter and one digit in a single token.\n\nTherefore, Option A is too restrictive and would not accept many of the True examples.\n\nOption B, which requires only that there is a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run, fits all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(\"task9\": letter(s) + digit, not uppercase, not ending with digits)\n- Her coat size is M3 in that brand. (\"M3\": uppercase letter + digit)\n- I scribbled ref9a in the corner.

(\"set3\": lowercase letters + digit)\n- The label on the jar reads Lot7C. (\"Lot7C\": uppercase letter + lowercase letters + digit + uppercase letter)\n- I saved the draft as doc3 before closing. (\"doc3\": lowercase letters + digit)\n- They pitched Tent3B by the stream. (\"Tent3B\": uppercase letter + lowercase letters + digit + uppercase letter)\n- They ordered part 2A from the catalog. (\"2A\": digit + uppercase letter)\n- The kids loved playing on Platform9 at the park. (\"Platform9\": uppercase letter + lowercase letters + digit)\n- The recipe calls for GradeA2 milk. (\"GradeA2\": uppercase letter + lowercase letters + uppercase letter + digit)\n- We found trail marker R12 near the bend. (\"R12\": uppercase letter + digits)\n- Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.

(\"X5G\": uppercase letter + digit + uppercase letter)\n- The map marks checkpoint K12 near the ridge. (\"K12\": uppercase letter + digits)\n\nNow, let's look at Option B: \"alphanumeric token that starts with an uppercase letter and ends with digits.\"\n\n- \"e4\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"task9\" (starts with lowercase, ends with digit) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"ref9a\" (starts with lowercase, ends with letter) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"B12G\" (starts with uppercase, ends with letter) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"2A\" (starts with digit, ends with uppercase letter) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"3V\" (starts with digit, ends with uppercase letter) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n- \"7b\" (starts with digit, ends with lowercase letter) -- would be False under B, but is True.\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct, because many True examples do not start with uppercase and end with digits.\n\nNow, Option A: \"contains an alphanumeric token that includes at least one letter and at least one digit within a single contiguous run.\"\n\nAll the True examples above have at least one token (word) that contains both a letter and a digit, in any order, and possibly more letters or digits.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples:\n\n- She read 12 pages and took a break.

But many True examples (like r12, bin42a, 5c, v2, etc.) do not start with uppercase or end with digits.\n- Option B only requires a contiguous alphanumeric token with at least one letter and at least one digit, regardless of order or case. This matches all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack.\n   - \"size10a\" (starts with lowercase, ends with a letter, not digits)\n   - Option A: No (doesn't start with uppercase, doesn't end with digits)\n   - Option B: Yes (contains \"size10a\", a contiguous run with both letters and digits)\n\n2.

Insert coin type 5c into the slot.\n   - \"5c\" (starts with digit, ends with letter)\n   - Option A: No (doesn't start with uppercase, doesn't end with digits)\n   - Option B: Yes (contains both letters and digits)\n\n5. The keypad flashed code 7b on error.\n   - \"7b\" (starts with digit, ends with letter)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: Yes\n\n6. Her coat size is M3 in that brand.\n   - \"M3\" (starts with uppercase, ends with digit)\n   - Option A: Yes\n   - Option B: Yes\n\n7. Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.\n   - \"H2O\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: Yes\n\n8. Look for bin42a in the storage room.\n   - \"bin42a\" (starts with lowercase, ends with letter)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: Yes\n\n9. I scribbled ref9a in the corner.\n   - \"ref9a\" (starts with lowercase, ends with letter)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: Yes\n\n10. The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\n    - \"C3PO\" (starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase)\n    - Option A: No\n    - Option B: Yes\n\n### False Examples\n\n1. The storm left 5 inches of snow.\n   - \"5\" (just a digit)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: No\n\n2.

The village has 300 residents in total.\n   - \"300\" (just digits)\n   - Option A: No\n   - Option B: No\n\n### Analysis\n\n- Option A is too restrictive. Many True examples do not start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n- Option B fits all True examples: as long as there is a token with both letters and digits in a single contiguous run, it's True.\n- All False examples lack such a token.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nOption B is the correct rule.\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

All True examples have such a token, and all False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}\n```",

rules:\n\nOption A: Requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits.\n- \"B3\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with digit. OK.\n- \"C3PO\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase. Not OK.\n- \"B12G\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase. Not OK.\n- \"PO17\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with digit. OK.\n- \"Table4\" (True): starts with uppercase, ends with digit.

Not accepted.\n- \"PO\" (False): letters only. Not accepted.\n- \"A\" (False): letter only. Not accepted.\n- \"14\" (False): digits only. Not accepted.\n- \"10\" (False): digits only. Not accepted.\n- \"3\" (False): digit only. Not accepted.\n- \"C\" (False): letter only.

These would be excluded by Option B, but are included by Option A.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

True examples:\n\n- \"She wore the model ZX14 boots to the party.\" (ZX14: letter(s) + digit(s))\n- \"Classroom C12 is reserved today.\" (C12: letter + digits)\n- \"I folded the note into envelope

campsite C7E before dawn.\" (C7E: letter + digit + letter)\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"They counted 40 chairs in the hall.\" (40: digits only)\n- \"The watch stopped at 12 exactly.\" (12: digits only)\n- \"There were 19 candles on the cake.\" (19: digits only)\n- \"He filled out form C before lunch.\" (C: letter only)\n- \"Please stack 16 logs by the wall.\" (16: digits

only)\n- \"He bought 350 apples at the market.\" (350: digits only)\n- \"The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\" (nine: word, not alphanumeric token)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: Accepts any alphanumeric token (contiguous run) with at least one letter and at least one digit, regardless of order or case.\nOption B: Accepts only tokens that start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n\nLet's test Option B against some True examples:\n- \"The keypad flashed code 7b on error.\" (7b: starts with digit, ends with letter, not uppercase letter, but is True)\n- \"He set variable x1 to zero.\" (x1: starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit, not uppercase, but is True)\n- \"We crossed checkpoint z13 at sunset.\" (z13: starts with lowercase letter, ends with digits, not uppercase, but is True)\n- \"Look for bin42a in the storage room.\" (bin42a: starts with lowercase letter, ends with letter, not uppercase, but is True)\n- \"Her playlist included song set3 for practice.\" (set3: starts with lowercase letter, ends with digit, not uppercase, but is True)\n- \"The concert is in Hall 3B near the entrance.\" (3B: starts with digit, ends with letter, but is True)\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct, because many True examples do not start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, fits all True examples: every True example contains at least one token with both a letter and a digit in a single contiguous run, regardless of order or case.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Let's check:\n\n- X5G: X, 5, G (yes)\n- L8: L, 8 (yes)\n- ref9a: r, e, f, 9, a (yes)\n- B12G: B, 1, 2, G (yes)\n- C3PO: C, 3, P, O (yes)\n- R4C: R, 4, C (yes)\n- D3: D, 3 (yes)\n- G10B: G, 1, 0, B (yes)\n- C4: C, 4 (yes)\n- A1: A, 1 (yes)\n- 12B: 1, 2, B (yes)\n- lot9B: l, o, t, 9, B (yes)\n- Room7C: R, o, o, m, 7, C (yes)\n- Figure2A: F, i, g, u, r, e, 2, A (yes)\n- R5: R, 5 (yes)\n- red7: r, e, d, 7 (yes)\n- task9: t, a, s, k, 9 (yes)\n- 2A: 2, A (yes)\n- B7: B, 7 (yes)\n- T2: T, 2 (yes)\n- P3: P, 3 (yes)\n- ch9: c, h, 9 (yes)\n- F9: F, 9 (yes)\n- Gallery3: G, a, l, l, e, r, y, 3 (yes)\n\nAll True examples have a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples:\n\n- \"Press the red button to reset.\" (no such token)\n- \"The bus arrives at stop D next.\" (no such token)\n- \"She read 12 pages and took a break.\" (12 is only digits)\n- \"The bill came to $75 after tax.\" (75 is only digits)\n- \"He ordered size large from the catalog.\" (no such token)\n- \"Please deliver to Box A at reception.\" (A is only letter)\n- \"Bring three bowls and a pot.\" (no such token)\n- \"He ordered set number 10 for lunch.\" (10 is only digits)\n- \"The flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes.\" (50, 13 are only digits)\n- \"I saw 1 comet through the telescope.\" (1 is only digit)\n- \"Our test was on page ten of the guide.\" (ten is only letters)\n- \"The letter was addressed to PO Box.\" (PO is only letters)\n- \"She took bus line 7 after work.\" (7 is only digit)\n- \"Turn key to position A when ready.\" (A is only letter)\n- \"We looked at plan A and chose it.\" (A is only letter)\n- \"The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\" (nine is only letters)\n- \"The team scored 3 goals in the match.\" (3 is only digit)\n- \"We took highway 5 after the tolls.\" (5 is only digit)\n- \"Set alarm for 7 and sleep early.\" (7 is only digit)\n- \"Our seats are in row D and E.\" (D, E are only letters)\n- \"Dinner begins at 6 o'clock in the hall.\" (6 is only digit)\n- \"The child turned 6 this spring.\" (6 is only digit)\n- \"The key is in drawer 2 of the desk.\" (2 is only digit)\n- \"The tent is stored in bin 4.\" (4 is only digit)\n- \"The code was lost during the transfer.\" (no such token)\n- \"The sign read Exit 4 ahead.\" (4 is only digit)\n- \"They ordered combo number 3 at noon.\" (3 is only digit)\n- \"Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.\" (30, 350 are only digits)\n- \"The class starts at 8 and ends at 9.\" (8, 9 are only digits)\n- \"The plane departs at 10 tomorrow.\" (10 is only digit)\n- \"Turn to track nine for the classic.\" (nine is only letters)\n- \"He finished fifth in the race.\" (fifth is only letters)\n- \"I left my coat in locker 18.\" (18 is only digits)\n- \"We rented row E for the show.\" (E is only letter)\n- \"I saved 100 photos on my phone.\" (100 is only digits)\n\nNone of these have a token with both a letter and a digit in a single contiguous run.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Fits both A and B.\n\n- \"Our lab uses H2O as the solvent.\"\n  - \"H2O\" is an alphanumeric token, contains both letter and digit, but ends with a letter. Fits A, not B.\n\n- \"He fixed the bug in func2 before lunch.\"\n  - \"func2\" is an alphanumeric token, contains both letter and digit, but does not start with uppercase nor end with digits. Fits A, not B.\n\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\"\n  - \"C3PO\" is an alphanumeric token, contains both letter and digit, but ends with a letter.

Fits A, not B.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples:\n\n- \"The storm left 5 inches of snow.\"\n  - \"5\" is only a digit, not alphanumeric with both letter and digit. Fits A and B as False.\n\n- \"Her bag weighed 12 ounces after drying.\"\n  - \"12\" is only digits. Fits A and B as False.\n\n- \"Seven sparrows drifted quietly over the bay.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit. Fits A and B as False.\n\n- \"He took bus line 7 after work.\"\n  - \"7\" is only digit. Fits A and B as False.\n\n- \"The cashier gave back 8 coins.\"\n  - \"8\" is only digit.

digit only)\n- \"Bake for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.\" (350: digits only)\n- \"Rain began at 5 and ended by 8.\" (5, 8: digits only)\n- \"The label says Grade A on the carton.\" (A: letter only)\n- \"The shop opens at nine on Sunday.\" (no such token)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits. But many True examples do not fit this:\n- x1 (starts with lowercase)\n- doc3 (starts with lowercase)\n- set3 (starts with lowercase)\n- 3V (starts with digit)\n- 14B (starts with digit)\n- 7b (starts with digit)\n- size10a (ends with letter)\n- ref9a (ends with letter)\n- fox2 (ends with digit, but starts with lowercase)\n- func2 (starts with lowercase)\n- Gate32B (ends with uppercase letter)\n- X5G (ends with uppercase letter)\n- Dock7A (ends with uppercase letter)\n- lotC3 (starts with lowercase)\n- River9 (ends with digit, but starts with uppercase)\n\nOption B only requires that there is a token (a contiguous run of letters and digits) that contains at least one letter and at least one digit. This fits all the True examples and excludes the False ones, which only have tokens with only letters or only digits, or no such token at all.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

\n\nNow, let's check the False examples for counterexamples:\n\n- \"They ordered combo number 3 at noon.\"  \n  Token: 3 (digit only, not alphanumeric with both letter and digit)  \n- \"Seven sparrows drifted quietly over the bay.\"  \n  No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit  \n- \"He ordered size large from the catalog.\"  \n  No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit  \n- \"We met at building C across the quad.\"  \n  Token: C (letter only)  \n- \"I saw 1 comet through the telescope.\"  \n  Token: 1 (digit only)  \n- \"The museum opens at 9 on weekdays.\"  \n  Token: 9

Token: 350 (digit only)  \n- \"The farmer sold 14 hens at market.\"  \n  Token: 14 (digit only)  \n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A requires the token to start with an uppercase letter and end with digits.  \nBut many True examples do not end with digits (e.g., Lot7C, R4C, B12G, X5G, Dock7A, etc.), and some start with lowercase (e.g., fox2, ref9a, task9, x1, bin42a).\n\nOption B requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run.  \nAll True examples have such a token (e.g., G7, Sector9B, lot9B, ZX14, fox2, x1, etc.), and all False examples lack such a token.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"Press the red button to reset.\"  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"He filled out form C before lunch.\"  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"They live on Third Street downtown.\"  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"The parcel weighs 4 kg on the scale.\"  \n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\nNow, let's check if any False example would be accepted by Option B but not Option A. For example, \"Grade A\" or \"Exit 4\" or \"Gate A\" or \"Row E\" or \"Block B\" or \"form C\" or \"page 3\" or \"Pier Nine\" or \"locker 18\" or \"Gate A\" or \"room 12\" or \"level 2\" or \"line 7\" or \"mile 14\" or \"row E\" or \"Exit 4\" or \"page 3\" or \"position A\" or \"Block B\" or \"form C\" or \"Third Street\" or \"4 kg\" -- none of these have an alphanumeric token with both a letter and a digit.\n\nNow, let's check if any True example would be rejected by Option B but accepted by Option A. For example, \"k9\", \"f1\", \"z13\", \"Bay4B\", \"C7E\", \"Pier9A\", \"e4\", \"Mr9\", \"lotC3\", \"func2\", \"Apt4C\", \"v2\", \"Track5\", \"s12\", \"C3PO\", \"G10B\", \"B12G\", \"Dock7A\", \"H2O\", \"r12\" -- all of these would be rejected by Option B because they do not start with an uppercase letter and end with digits, but they are accepted by Option A.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only rule that fits all the True and False examples.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(\"h3\": starts with lowercase, ends with digit)\n- Deliver crate to Bay4B by noon. (\"Bay4B\": starts with uppercase, ends with uppercase)\n- He grabbed wrench size10a from the rack. (\"size10a\": starts with lowercase, ends with lowercase)\n\nNow, let's check the False examples for counterexamples:\n\n- He circled item B on the form. (\"B\": only letter, no digit)\n- We left at 4 and returned by dusk. (\"4\": only digit, no letter)\n- Turn to track nine for the classic. (\"nine\": only letters)\n- The team scored 3 goals in the match. (\"3\": only digit)\n- They live on the fourteenth floor. (\"fourteenth\": only letters)\n- Turn to chapter 4 and read aloud. (\"4\": only digit)\n- The sign read Exit 4 ahead. (\"4\": only digit)\n- They counted 40 chairs in the hall. (\"40\": only digits)\n- Take exit 22 after the bridge. (\"22\": only digits)\n- The match ends at 0 to 0 if tied. (\"0\": only digit)\n- Her flight boards at Gate A soon. (\"A\": only letter)\n- I found 9 shells on the beach.

(\"8\", \"9\": only digits)\n- Our test was on page ten of the guide. (\"ten\": only letters)\n- The plane departs at 10 tomorrow. (\"10\": only digits)\n- He ordered set number 10 for lunch. (\"10\": only digits)\n- I paid 20 dollars for the ticket. (\"20\": only digits)\n- The museum opens at 9 on weekdays. (\"9\": only digit)\n- They live on Third Street downtown. (\"Third\": only letters)\n- I saw 4 birds circle the pier. (\"4\": only digit)\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits. But we have True examples like \"ref9a\", \"id6\", \"h3\", \"size10a\", \"doc3\", \"e4\", \"v2\", which start with lowercase and/or end with a letter. So Option A is too restrictive.\n\nOption B requires a token with at least one letter and at least one digit in a single contiguous run. All True examples have such a token (e.g., \"ref9a\", \"id6\", \"h3\", \"size10a\", \"doc3\", \"e4\", \"v2\", \"A1\", \"B19\", \"C3PO\", \"Lot7C\", \"Bay4B\", etc.). All False examples lack such a token (they have only digits or only letters, but not both in a single token).\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nJSON answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Satisfies both A and B.\n\n- \"The label on the jar reads Lot7C.\"\n  - Lot7C: starts with uppercase, but ends with a letter, not digits. Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"She tuned the radio to FM2 for the concert.\"\n  - FM2: starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Satisfies both.\n\n- \"She filed claim id6 with the clerk.\"\n  - id6: starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"The robot named C3PO waved at the crowd.\"\n  - C3PO: starts with uppercase, ends with letter. Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"He drew card Q4 from the stack.\"\n  - Q4: starts with uppercase, ends with digit. Satisfies both.\n\n- \"She wrote down code X5G for the sample.\"\n  - X5G: starts with uppercase, ends with letter. Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"The vet said cat B12G needs rest.\"\n  - B12G: starts with uppercase, ends with letter.

Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"He won with move e4 in the opening.\"\n  - e4: starts with lowercase, ends with digit. Satisfies B, not A.\n\n- \"Power the device with 3V batteries only.\"\n  - 3V: starts with digit, ends with letter. Satisfies B, not A.\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n\n- \"The class starts at 8 and ends at 9.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"The key is in drawer 2 of the desk.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"I need 2 eggs and some milk.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"They counted 40 chairs in the hall.\"\n  - No alphanumeric token with both letter and digit.\n\n- \"He wrote the date 2021 on the form.\"\n  - 2021: digits only.\n\nSo, Option A requires the token to start with uppercase and end with digits. But many True examples (Lot7C, id6, C3PO, X5G, B12G, s12, e4, 3V) do not end with digits or do not start with uppercase.\n\nOption B only requires a contiguous alphanumeric token with at least one letter and at least one digit, in any order.\n\nTherefore, Option B fits all True examples and excludes all False examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",
