For example, \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" has \"You’re\" and \"hotel’s\", but neither is a contraction ending with 't. Similarly, \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" has \"We’ll\" and \"Julie’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't. So Option A cannot be the rule.\n\nOption B: Many True examples have words like \"hotel’s\", \"Julie’s\", \"plane’s\", \"actor’s\", \"gardener’s\", \"engine’s\", \"student’s\", \"lab’s\", \"weatherman’s\", \"chef’s\", \"choir’s\", \"island’s\", \"cat’s\", \"owner’s\", \"brewer’s\", \"farmer’s\", \"castle’s\", \"dancer’s\", \"brother’s\", \"sailor’s\", \"painter’s\", \"choir’s\", \"director’s\", \"Grandma’s\", \"Mom’s\", \"coach’s\", \"child’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"doctor’s\", \"printer’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"choir’s\", \"program’s\", \"sister’s\", \"o’clock\", \"lab’s\", \"vineyard’s\", \"baby’s\", \"ship’s\", etc. All of these have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: None of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text is: \"The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\"\n\nThis contains \"cat’s\" (internal apostrophe between two letters), so according to Option B, it should be True.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n-

boxes.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending with 't: wouldn't, didn't, isn't, shouldn't, weren't, couldn't, doesn't, won't, etc.\n- However, many True examples are accepted even when the only apostrophe is in a possessive (e.g., \"the cat’s collar\", \"the park’s fountain\", \"the artist’s work\", \"the broker’s office\", \"the child’s drawing\", \"the river’s edge\", \"the region’s drought\", \"the barista’s latte\", \"the library’s hours\", \"the student’s thesis\", \"the village’s well\", \"the scouts’ leader\", \"the ship’s engine\", \"the plane’s tire\", \"the mechanic’s wrench\", \"the weatherman’s forecast\", \"the county’s fair\", \"the lab’s results\", \"the team’s jerseys\", \"the twins’ recital\", \"the vineyard’s crop\", \"the gallery’s theme\", \"the harbor’s mouth\", \"the owner’s address\", \"grandma’s fridge\", \"Julie’s notes\", \"Dad’s car\", \"Claire’s cousin\", \"Maya’s expectations\", \"her sister’s letter\", \"her brother's guitar\", \"everyone’s input\").\n- Many of these do NOT have a contraction ending in 't, but do have a possessive with an internal apostrophe.\n\nOption A cannot be correct, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n- All the True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe: either a contraction (e.g., \"didn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"isn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"weren't\", \"couldn't\", \"doesn't\", \"won't\", \"didn't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"hasn't\", \"haven't\", \"hadn't\", \"would've\", \"should've\", \"could've\", \"they'd\",

(has \"couldn't\", so fits B)\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview. (has \"he’ll\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (has \"didn't\", fits B)\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (has \"you’d\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast. (has \"doesn't\", fits B)\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (has \"I’ve\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths. (has \"didn't\", fits B)\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard. (has \"I’ll\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys. (has \"it’s\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios. (has \"didn't\", fits B)\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later. (has \"don't\", fits B)\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (has \"wasn't\", fits B)\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back. (has \"she’ll\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side. (has \"shouldn't\", fits B)\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s. (has \"isn't\", fits B)\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready. (has \"we’re\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations. (has \"didn't\", fits B)\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out. (has \"doesn't\", fits B)\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish. (has \"there’s\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage. (has \"we’ve\", not ending in 't, so does not fit B)\n- I can't believe it's already Friday. (has \"can't\", fits B)\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks. (has \"didn't\", fits B)\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry. (has \"won't\", fits B)\n\nSo, Option B would only accept sentences with a contraction ending in 't, but many True examples do not have such a contraction, but do have a possessive or other contraction with an internal apostrophe.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, would accept any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe, which includes possessives (e.g., \"the island’s ferry\"), contractions (e.g., \"didn’t\"), and other forms (e.g., \"I’m\", \"he’ll\", \"we’re\", \"there’s\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\nThe bakery across town closed last month.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe? No.\n\nDoes it contain a contraction ending in 't? No.\n\nSo, according to both rules, this would be False.\n\nNow, which rule is correct? Based on the above, Option A is correct, because it matches all the True examples, while Option B does not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- The team gathered around the whiteboard.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The bakery donated bread to the shelter.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- We took the scenic route through the

renovation.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True

(contains \"it’d\" and \"weatherman’s\" and \"weren’t\")\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing. (\"ship’s\", \"wouldn’t\")\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected. (\"teacher’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"I’d\")\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time. (\"They’d\", \"children’s\")\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening. (\"I’m\", \"vineyard’s\", \"isn’t\")\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite. (\"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\")\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget. (\"company’s\", \"didn’t\", \"year’s\")\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out. (\"She’s\", \"county’s\", \"doesn’t\")\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late. (\"It’s\", \"city’s\", \"don’t\")\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (\"You’d\", \"cat’s\")\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home. (\"It’s\", \"I’m\", \"they’re\")\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker. (\"scouts’\", \"couldn’t\", \"trail’s\")\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year. (\"They’re\", \"town’s\")\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s. (\"Grandma’s\", \"isn’t\", \"Mom’s\")\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage. (\"We’ve\", \"children’s\")\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (\"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\")\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital. (\"Claire’s\", \"isn’t\", \"twins’\")\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly. (\"library’s\", \"weren’t\")\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths. (\"festival’s\", \"didn’t\", \"vendors’\")\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (\"I’ve\", \"gardener’s\")\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth. (\"There’ll\", \"harbor’s\")\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (\"child’s\", \"didn’t\", \"grandma’s\")\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal. (\"choir’s\", \"didn’t\")\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car. (\"It’ll\", \"we’re\", \"Dad’s\")\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine. (\"You’re\", \"hotel’s\")\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show. (\"She's\", \"brother's\")\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants. (\"He’d\", \"neighbor’s\")\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm. (\"region’s\", \"wouldn’t\")\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years. (\"She’d\", \"sister’s\")\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew. (\"O’Malley’s\", \"city’s\")\n\nSo, in these True examples, there are many words with an internal apostrophe between two letters, such as \"teacher’s\", \"company’s\", \"children’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"O’Malley’s\", etc., and not all of them are contractions ending in 't.\n\nOption B would not accept sentences that only have possessives or contractions not ending in 't, but many True examples have only possessives or other contractions.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, accepts any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, which includes possessives (e.g., \"teacher’s\", \"company’s\"), contractions (e.g., \"I’m\", \"they’re\", \"it’s\"), and names (e.g., \"O’Malley’s\").\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\nThe author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n\nThis sentence contains:\n- \"author’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n- \"wasn’t\" (contraction ending in 't, internal apostrophe)\n- \"book’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, both Option A and Option B would accept this sentence, but the rule that fits all the True examples is Option A, because it covers all cases where there is a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, not just contractions ending in 't.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- The cinema reopened with a classic film.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- Coffee spilled onto the wooden floor.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", \"won't\", \"couldn't\", \"wasn't\", \"isn't\", \"didn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"couldn't\", \"wasn't\", \"isn't\", \"didn't\" etc. are all present in the True examples.\n- However, some True examples also have contractions like \"He’ll\", \"We’ll\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Examine the True Examples\n\nLet's look at some True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the False Examples\n\nSome False examples:\n\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- The kettle whistled from the stove.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Two Rule Options\n\n#### Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nThis would include:\n- Contractions (e.g., don’t, isn’t, I’m, you’ll, I’ve, etc.)\n- Possessives (e.g., ship’s, director’s, today’s, festival’s, choir’s, cousin’s, twins’, grandma’s, mom’s, bell’s, vineyard’s, friend’s, carpool, dog’s, shelter’s, gardener’s, lab’s, mechanic’s, actor’s, baker’s, Poe’s, teacher’s, doctor’s, cat’s, owner’s, choir’s, dancer’s, brewer’s, everyone’s, etc.)\n- O’clock\n\nAll the True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n#### Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nThis would only include sentences with contractions like \"can't\", \"won't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", etc.\n\nBut many True examples do not have such a contraction:\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing. (this one fits)\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule. (this one fits)\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s. (this one fits)\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (this one fits)\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home. (doesn't fit, \"it's\" is not ending in 't)\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella. (doesn't fit)\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (doesn't fit)\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient. (doesn't fit)\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (doesn't fit)\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready. (doesn't fit)\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast. (this one fits)\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news. (doesn't fit)\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected. (this one fits)\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed. (this one fits)\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired. (doesn't fit)\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address. (this one fits)\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service. (this one fits)\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine. (this one fits)\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste. (this one fits)\n\nSo, while many True examples do have a contraction ending in 't, many others do not, but they do have other words with internal apostrophes (possessives, o’clock, etc.).\n\n### Step 4: Apply to the New Example\n\nNew text:\nYou’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n\n- \"You’ll\" (contraction, internal apostrophe)\n- \"train’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n\nBoth words have internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nOption A is the correct rule, as it covers all True examples (contractions, possessives, o’clock, etc.), while Option B is too narrow.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

No. For example, \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" contains \"he’ll\" and \"he’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" contains \"O’Malley’s\", which is a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\" contains \"she's\" and \"brother's\", neither of which end with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct.\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n- \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" contains \"He’s\", \"printer’s\", \"wasn’t\" — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" contains \"O’Malley’s\".\n- \"She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\" contains \"she's\", \"brother's\".\n- \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\" contains \"It’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\".\n- All True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"A bicycle bell rang behind me.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"The bakery across town closed last month.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" — \"o’clock\" has an internal apostrophe, but let's check if this is a special case. In the True examples, \"o’clock\" does not appear, but in the False examples, it does.

(no apostrophe)\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs. (no apostrophe)\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down. (no apostrophe)\n- Coffee spilled onto the wooden floor. (no apostrophe)\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning. (no apostrophe)\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack. (no apostrophe)\n- We shared a taxi to the train station. (no apostrophe)\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator. (no apostrophe)\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate. (no apostrophe)\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.

(no apostrophe)\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge. (no apostrophe)\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit. (no apostrophe)\n- The bakery across town closed last month. (no apostrophe)\n\nNone of the False examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the rule to the new text\n\nNew text: \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\"\n\n- \"He’d\" (internal apostrophe between two letters)\n- \"neighbor’s\" (internal apostrophe between two letters)\n\nSo, according to Option A, this should be True.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the correct rule\n\nOption A fits all the True and False examples, while Option B does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- A rainbow appeared over the

accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n\n- \"She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\" (True) — contains \"she’ll\" and \"she’s\", neither ends with 't.\n- \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (True) — contains \"he’s\", not ending with 't.\n- \"The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\" (True) — contains \"didn’t\" (ends with 't), but also \"child’s\" and \"grandma’s\".\n- \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\" (True) — contains \"he’d\", not ending with 't.\n- \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (True) — contains \"she’d\", not ending with 't.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (True) — contains \"o’clock\", not ending with 't.\n- \"I can't believe it's already Friday.\" (True) — contains \"can't\" (ends with 't), and \"it's\".\n- \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\" (True) — contains \"it’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\", none ending with 't.\n\nSo, many True examples do NOT have a contraction ending with 't, but do have a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's check:\n\n- \"She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\" — \"She’ll\", \"writer’s\", \"she’s\" all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" — \"He’s\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- She’s bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? No. For example, \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" is not a contraction ending with 't), \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There’ll\" does not end with 't), \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (\"You’re\" does not end with 't), etc.\n- Are all False examples missing such a contraction? Some False examples do not have any contractions, but the key is that many True examples have contractions that do not end with 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Do all True examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"didn’t\", \"tonight’s\", \"They’re\", \"We’ve\", \"children’s\", \"coach’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"I’m\", \"baby’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"teacher’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"o’clock\", \"dog’s\", \"shelter’s\", \"We’ll\", \"Julie’s\", \"park’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\", \"pilot’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"Alex’s\", \"You’re\", \"hotel’s\", \"She’s\", \"brother's\", \"You’ll\", \"train’s\", \"storm’s\", \"shouldn’t\", \"island’s\", \"You’d\", \"they’d\", \"didn’t\", \"You’d\", \"cat’s\", \"artist’s\", \"gallery’s\", \"river’s\", \"shouldn’t\", \"Don’t\", \"today’s\", \"You’ll\", \"We’ve\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\", \"He’s\", \"week’s\", \"She’d\", \"sister’s\", \"We’re\", \"camp’s\", \"won’t\", \"I’m\", \"vineyard’s\", \"isn’t\", \"There’ll\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\", \"broker’s\", \"isn’t\", \"He’s\", \"printer’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"I’d\", \"Poe’s\", \"today’s\", \"cat’s\", \"owner’s\", \"There’s\", \"painter’s\", \"student’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"lab’s\".\n- All of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\"The trail map shows several steep climbs.\"\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be False.\n\nNow, which rule explains the examples?

Therefore, Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" — \"There’s\" has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" — \"She’d\" has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\" — \"Claire’s\" and \"isn’t\" both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\" — \"cat’s\", \"didn’t\", \"owner’s\" all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" — \"o’clock\" has an internal apostrophe.\n\nAll True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\"\n\n- \"He’s\" — internal apostrophe between \"e\" and \"s\"\n- \"printer’s\" — internal apostrophe between \"r\" and \"s\"\n- \"wasn’t\" — internal apostrophe between \"n\" and \"t\"\n\nSo, this sentence contains multiple words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\" (contains \"wouldn’t\"), but \"The coach’s\" also has an apostrophe. \"We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\" (\"We’ll\" is a contraction, but not ending in 't). \"He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\" (\"He’s\", \"village’s\", \"won’t\"). There are many examples where the only apostrophe is in a possessive or a contraction not ending in 't.\n- There are True examples with only possessives, e.g., \"The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\" (\"broker’s\", \"isn’t\"). \"The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\" (\"artist’s\", \"didn’t\", \"gallery’s\"). So, many True examples do have a contraction ending in 't, but not all. Some have only possessives.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n  - \"The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\" (\"coach’s\", \"wouldn’t\")\n  - \"We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\" (\"We’ll\", \"everyone’s\")\n  - \"He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\" (\"He’s\", \"village’s\", \"won’t\")\n  - \"The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\" (\"museum’s\", \"didn’t\", \"traveler’s\")\n  - \"The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\" (\"ranger’s\", \"didn’t\", \"hikers’\")\n  - \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\" (\"It’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\")\n  - \"The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\" (\"student’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"lab’s\")\n  - \"The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\" (\"broker’s\", \"isn’t\")\n  - \"The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\" (\"bird’s\", \"wasn’t\")\n  - \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" (\"He’s\", \"printer’s\", \"wasn’t\")\n  - \"There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\" (\"There’ll\", \"harbor’s\")\n  - \"She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\" (\"She’ll\", \"lab’s\", \"she’s\")\n  - \"That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\" (\"chef’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"tonight’s\")\n  - \"The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\" (\"baker’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"today’s\")\n  - \"The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\" (\"park’s\", \"wasn’t\")\n  - \"The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\" (\"child’s\", \"didn’t\", \"grandma’s\")\n  - \"The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\" (\"region’s\", \"wouldn’t\")\n  - \"The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\" (\"team’s\", \"couldn’t\")\n  - \"The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\" (\"mayor’s\", \"she’d\")\n  - \"Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\" (\"Sofia’s\", \"doesn’t\", \"baker’s\")\n  - \"It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\" (\"It’ll\", \"we’re\", \"Dad’s\")\n  - \"The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\" (\"artist’s\", \"didn’t\", \"gallery’s\")\n  - \"The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\" (\"brewer’s\", \"didn’t\", \"everyone’s\")\n  - \"The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\" (\"castle’s\", \"wouldn’t\")\n  - \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There’ll\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\")\n  - \"The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\" (\"teacher’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"I’d\")\n  - \"The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\" (\"editor’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"today’s\")\n  - \"The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\" (\"library’s\", \"weren’t\")\n  - \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\", \"Julie’s\", \"tomorrow’s\")\n  - \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\", \"children’s\")\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n- \"The yogurt expired two days ago.\" No apostrophe at all.\n\nSo, Option A fits: the rule is that the string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nOption B is too narrow, as it would only accept sentences with contractions ending in 't, but many True examples have only possessives or other contractions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- The kettle whistled from the stove.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending in 't: didn't, wouldn't, can't, wasn't, weren't, couldn't, etc.\n- However, there are also True examples with other contractions: I'm, it's, she's, he'll, I'll, we've, they're, etc. These do not end in 't.\n- There are also True examples with possessives: the lion’s roar, the island’s ferry, the festival’s map, the host’s table, the bird’s wing, the brewer’s stout, the dog’s tag, the farmer’s field, the clock’s hands, the mayor’s aide, the pilot’s log, the painter’s signature, the museum’s café, the printer’s error, the weatherman’s forecast, the ranger’s warning, the pianist’s hands, the director’s cut, the team’s jerseys, the children’s meals, the cat’s collar, the owner’s address, the choir’s hymn, Poe’s tales, today’s news, O’Malley’s pub, etc.\n\nSo Option A cannot be correct, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n- All the True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe: contractions (I'm, it's, she's, he'll, I'll, we've, they're, etc.), possessives (lion’s, island’s, festival’s, host’s, bird’s, brewer’s, dog’s, farmer’s, clock’s, mayor’s, pilot’s, painter’s, museum’s, printer’s, weatherman’s, ranger’s, pianist’s, director’s, team’s, children’s, cat’s, owner’s, choir’s, Poe’s, today’s, O’Malley’s), and so on.\n- The False examples do not have any words with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n\n- \"pilot’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n- \"wasn’t\" (contraction, internal apostrophe)\n- \"Alex’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, the new text contains multiple words with internal apostrophes.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

But many True examples do not have such contractions, e.g.:\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct.\n\nOption A says the string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters. Let's check this:\n\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks. (museum’s, café, didn’t, traveler’s: all have internal apostrophes)\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice. (He’s)\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed. (I’m, baby’s, wasn’t)\n- At five o’clock, the parade began. (o’clock)\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years. (She’d, sister’s)\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient. (You’ll, actor’s, you’re)\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service. (choir’s, didn’t, tonight’s)\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (park’s, wasn’t)\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nShe’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n\n- She’ll (internal apostrophe between e and l)\n- writer’s (internal apostrophe between r and s)\n- she’s (internal apostrophe between e and s)\n\nSo, according to Option A, this should be True.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\" contains \"I’m\" and \"clock’s\" and \"didn’t\". \"I’m\" and \"clock’s\" do not end with 't, but \"didn’t\" does. But there are other True examples like \"The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\" which has \"library’s\" and \"weren’t\". \"library’s\" does not end with 't, but \"weren’t\" does. However, \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" has \"O’Malley’s\" and \"city’s\", neither of which end with 't, and there is no contraction ending with 't. So Option B cannot be correct.\n\nNow, Option A:\n\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"clock’s\", \"library’s\", \"knight’s\", \"toddler’s\", \"river’s\", \"broker’s\", \"manager’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"printer’s\", \"festival’s\", \"vendors’\", \"children’s\", \"weatherman’s\", \"painter’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"father’s\", \"scouts’\", \"trail’s\", \"plane’s\", \"farmer’s\", \"baby’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\", \"company’s\", \"year’s\", \"doctor’s\", \"cat’s\", \"region’s\", \"friend’s\", \"carpool\", \"poet’s\", \"editor’s\", \"choir’s\", \"director’s\", \"student’s\", \"lab’s\", \"O’Malley’s\", \"city’s\", \"child’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"brother's\", \"castle’s\", etc.\n    - All of these have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"They waited quietly while the baby slept.\"\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this would be False.\n\nNow, which rule is correct? Option A is correct, because Option B is disproven by examples like \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" which is True but does not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" — \"You’re\", \"hotel’s\" — both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\" — \"We’re\", \"camp’s\", \"won’t\" — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\" — \"It’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\" — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" — \"o’clock\" — internal apostrophe.\n- \"The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\" — \"bird’s\", \"wasn’t\" — both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\" — \"Sofia’s\", \"doesn’t\", \"baker’s\" — all have internal apostrophes.\n\nAnd so on. All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check some False examples:\n\n- \"We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\" — no apostrophes.\n- \"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\" — no apostrophes.\n- \"A tall fence surrounds the garden.\" — no apostrophes.\n- \"They waited quietly while the baby slept.\" — no apostrophes.\n- \"The bakery donated bread to the shelter.\" — no apostrophes.\n\nAll False examples lack a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nThe lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n\n- \"lion’s\" — internal apostrophe.\n- \"didn’t\" — internal apostrophe.\n- \"keeper’s\" — internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, the new text fits Option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(O’Malley’s, city’s) -- these are possessives, not contractions ending in 't.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.

No. For example, \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" has \"she’s\" and \"she’d\", but \"she’s\" does not end with 't.\n- \"We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\" has \"we’ll\" and \"it’s\", neither of which end with 't.\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" has \"I’ve\", which does not end with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be the rule, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"She’s\" (she + is)\n    - \"She’d\" (she + had/would)\n    - \"We’ll\" (we + will)\n    - \"It’s\" (it + is)\n    - \"Wouldn’t\" (would + not)\n    - \"Didn’t\" (did + not)\n    - \"Doesn’t\" (does + not)\n    - \"Wasn’t\" (was + not)\n    - \"Haven’t\" (have + not)\n    - \"I’ve\" (I + have)\n    - \"Don’t\" (do + not)\n    - \"Didn’t\" (did + not)\n    - \"Couldn’t\" (could + not)\n    - \"Shouldn’t\" (should + not)\n    - \"Wouldn’t\" (would + not)\n    - \"Isn’t\" (is + not)\n    - \"It’d\" (it + would/had)\n    - \"We’ve\" (we + have)\n    - \"There’ll\" (there + will)\n    - \"He’ll\" (he + will)\n    - \"You’ll\" (you + will)\n    - \"Today’s\" (today + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Manager’s\" (manager + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Editor’s\" (editor + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Company’s\" (company + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Children’s\" (children + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Pilot’s\" (pilot + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Director’s\" (director + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Market’s\" (market + 's, possessive)\n    - \"County’s\" (county + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Storm’s\" (storm + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Lion’s\" (lion + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Keeper’s\" (keeper + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Sailor’s\" (sailor + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Gardener’s\" (gardener + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Festival’s\" (festival + 's, possessive)\n    - \"River’s\" (river + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Weatherman’s\" (weatherman + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Stadium’s\" (stadium + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Dad’s\" (dad + 's, possessive)\n    - \"Budget\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Log\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Invoice\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Notes\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Schedule\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Board\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Snacks\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Umbrella\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Taste\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Menu\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Stout\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Roar\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Journal\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Cut\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Edge\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Path\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Seat\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Bus\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Keys\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Snacks\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Forecast\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Office\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Stall\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Meals\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Log\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Invoice\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Schedule\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"Budget\" (no apostrophe)\n\nBut in every True example, there is at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (either a contraction or a possessive).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: Do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check a few:\n\n- \"The poet signed books after the talk.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"A cool mist drifted across the field.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"We took the scenic route through the hills.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"We stacked firewood beside the shed.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"A child waved from the bus window.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"The tide rose faster than expected.\" No apostrophe.\n- \"We arrived early and found good seats.\" No apostrophe.\n\nNone of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nThey waited quietly while the baby slept.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- The kettle whistled from the stove.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- The cinema reopened with a classic film.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Some True examples do have contractions ending in 't (didn’t, wasn’t, doesn’t, isn’t, won’t, can’t, etc.).\n- However, many True examples do NOT have such a contraction, e.g. \"I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\" (has \"I’m\" and \"baby’s\"), \"The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\" (has \"editor’s\" and \"today’s\"), \"The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\" (has \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"traveler’s\"), etc.\n- Also, some True examples have only possessives or contractions not ending in 't, e.g. \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (\"You’re\", \"hotel’s\"), \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (\"We’ve\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\"), etc.\n\nSo Option B cannot be the rule, because there are True examples without a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- All True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, e.g. \"didn’t\", \"editor’s\", \"today’s\", \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"traveler’s\", \"You’re\", \"hotel’s\", \"I’m\", \"baby’s\", \"We’ve\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\", \"He’s\", \"week’s\", etc.\n- All False examples lack such a word. They may have no apostrophes at all, or only at the end or beginning, or not between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text:\nHe’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n\nLet's check for words with an internal apostrophe between two letters:\n- He’s (H-e-’s)\n- printer’s (p-r-i-n-t-e-r-’s)\n- wasn’t (w-a-s-n-’t)\n\nAll three words have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this string should be accepted.\n\nSo, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" does not end with 't)\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (\"There’s\" is \"there is\", not ending with 't)\n- \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (\"He’s\" is \"he is\", not ending with 't)\n- \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\" is \"we have\", not ending with 't)\n- \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (\"You’re\" is \"you are\", not ending with 't)\n- \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (\"They’re\" is \"they are\", not ending with 't)\n- \"It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\" (\"It’d\" is \"it would\", not ending with 't)\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (\"I’ve\" is \"I have\", not ending with 't)\n\nSo, Option B cannot be the rule, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's check the True examples:\n\n- \"The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\" (\"choir’s\", \"didn’t\", \"tonight’s\" all have internal apostrophes)\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" has an internal apostrophe)\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (\"There’s\" has an internal apostrophe)\n- \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (\"He’s\" has an internal apostrophe)\n- \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\", \"children’s\" have internal apostrophes)\n- \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (\"You’re\", \"hotel’s\" have internal apostrophes)\n- \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (\"They’re\", \"town’s\" have internal apostrophes)\n- \"It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\" (\"It’d\", \"weatherman’s\", \"weren’t\" have internal apostrophes)\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (\"I’ve\", \"gardener’s\" have internal apostrophes)\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"The pie on the counter smells amazing.\" (no internal apostrophe)\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" (no internal apostrophe)\n- \"He taped a note to the refrigerator.\" (no internal apostrophe)\n- \"She drove along the coast with the windows down.\" (no internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, Option A fits: True examples always have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, and False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (you’re, hotel’s) – both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\" (we’re, host’s, isn’t) – all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (o’clock) – internal apostrophe.\n- \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" (he’s, printer’s, wasn’t) – all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (they’re, town’s) – both have internal apostrophes.\n\nNow, let's check a False example: \"The phone battery died during the call.\" – no internal apostrophe.\nAnother: \"The soup simmered for an hour.\" – no internal apostrophe.\nAnother: \"The bakery donated bread to the shelter.\" – no internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, Option B fits all the True and False examples.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nWe’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n\n- \"We’ll\" (we + will) – internal apostrophe.\n- \"farmer’s\" – internal apostrophe.\n- \"it’s\" – internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, the new text contains words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Let's check a few:\n\n- \"didn’t\" (yes)\n- \"isn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"couldn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wouldn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"won’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n- \"wasn’t\" (yes)\n\nBut also, some True examples have other contractions, like \"I’m\", \"We’ve\", \"They’ll\", \"She’d\", \"He’s\", \"It’ll\", \"You’ve\", \"You’d\", \"He’ll\", \"We’ll\", \"There’ll\", \"We’re\", etc. These do not end with 't.\n\nSo Option A is not correct, because there are True examples with contractions that do not end with 't.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's check this. In the True examples, we see:\n\n- \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"traveler’s\"\n- \"clock’s\", \"hands\"\n- \"Grandma’s\", \"Mom’s\"\n- \"manager’s\", \"stadium’s\"\n- \"children’s\"\n- \"ship’s\"\n- \"baker’s\", \"it’s\"\n- \"company’s\", \"year’s\"\n- \"broker’s\"\n- \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\"\n- \"sister’s\"\n- \"scouts’\", \"trail’s\"\n- \"village’s\"\n- \"Dad’s\"\n- \"choir’s\", \"program’s\"\n- \"father’s\", \"tomorrow’s\"\n- \"mayor’s\", \"citizens’\"\n- \"farmer’s\"\n- \"mechanic’s\"\n- \"teacher’s\"\n- \"poet’s\"\n- \"bird’s\"\n- \"ranger’s\", \"hikers’\"\n- \"island’s\"\n- \"knight’s\"\n- \"editor’s\"\n- \"children’s\"\n- \"sailor’s\"\n- \"dog’s\", \"shelter’s\"\n- \"o’clock\"\n- \"baker’s\", \"market’s\"\n- \"director’s\", \"festival’s\"\n- \"camp’s\", \"lights\", \"night\"\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe (possessive or contraction).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"power lines\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"mural\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"cabin\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"coast\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"tea\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"meteors\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"kettle\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"tide\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"power\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"yogurt\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"engine\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"soup\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"sparrow\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"seat\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"child\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"route\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"seats\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"form\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"mist\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"bakery\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"rainbow\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"kids\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"tea\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"bakery\" (no apostrophe)\n\nSo, Option B fits: True examples always have a word with an internal apostrophe (possessive or contraction), and False examples do not.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nA violin solo echoed through the hall.\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe? No.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Option B.\n\nJSON: {\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No contraction ending with 't.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" — \"o’clock\" (contraction, but not ending with 't).\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" — \"There’ll\" (contraction, not ending with 't), \"baker’s\", \"market’s\" (possessive).\n- \"The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\" — \"knight’s\" (possessive), \"couldn’t\" (contraction ending with 't).\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" — \"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\".\n\nSo, some True examples have a contraction ending with 't, but many do not. Many have only possessives or other contractions.\n\n### Step 3: Test Option A (internal apostrophe between two letters)\n\nOption A says the string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's check the same examples:\n\n- \"We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\" — \"We’ll\" (internal apostrophe), \"everyone’s\" (internal), \"Friday’s\" (internal).\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" — \"O’Malley’s\" (internal), \"city’s\" (internal).\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" — \"o’clock\" (internal).\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" — \"There’ll\" (internal), \"baker’s\" (internal), \"market’s\" (internal).\n- \"The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\" — \"knight’s\" (internal), \"couldn’t\" (internal).\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" — \"poet’s\" (internal), \"weren’t\" (internal), \"editor’s\" (internal).\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n### Step 4: Check False examples\n\nSome False examples:\n- He balanced the tray with one hand. — No apostrophe.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon. — No apostrophe.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light. — No apostrophe.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class. — No apostrophe.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago. — No apostrophe.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic. — No apostrophe.\n- The calendar still shows last month. — No apostrophe.\n- The bus stops near the art studio. — No apostrophe.\n- The soup simmered for an hour. — No apostrophe.\n\nNone of these have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n### Step 5: Apply to the new text\n\nNew text: \"The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\"\n\n- \"ship’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"wouldn’t\" — internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nBoth Option A and Option B would accept this, since \"wouldn’t\" is a contraction ending with 't.\n\n### Step 6: Decide which rule is correct\n\nOption A is more general and fits all True examples, including those with only possessives or other contractions (not ending with 't). Option B is too narrow, as many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n```json\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}\n```",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- The kettle whistled from the stove.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? No. For example, \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" contains \"He’ll\" and \"father’s\", but neither ends with 't.\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" contains \"O’Malley’s\", which is a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\" contains \"cat’s\" and \"owner’s\", which are possessives, and \"didn’t\", which is a contraction ending with 't. But there are many True examples where the only apostrophe is in a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be the rule, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"He’ll\" (He + ’ll), \"father’s\" (possessive), \"barista’s\" (possessive), \"couldn’t\" (contraction), \"O’Malley’s\" (name with internal apostrophe), \"baby’s\" (possessive),

\"everyone’s\" (possessive), \"library’s\" (possessive), \"lion’s\" (possessive), \"keeper’s\" (possessive), \"doctor’s\" (possessive), \"Poe’s\" (possessive), \"today’s\" (possessive), \"baker’s\" (possessive), \"market’s\" (possessive), \"poet’s\" (possessive), \"pianist’s\" (possessive), \"castle’s\" (possessive), \"child’s\" (possessive), \"grandma’s\" (possessive), \"hotel’s\" (possessive),

(possessive), \"shelter’s\" (possessive), \"cat’s\" (possessive), \"mayor’s\" (possessive), \"plane’s\" (possessive), \"writer’s\" (possessive), \"mayor’s\" (possessive), \"citizens’\" (possessive plural), \"actor’s\" (possessive), \"region’s\" (possessive), \"toddler’s\" (possessive), \"dad’s\" (possessive).\n    - Also, contractions like \"He’ll\", \"didn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"weren’t\", \"I’m\", \"She’s\", \"He’s\", \"We’ve\", \"We’d\", \"They’d\", \"She’d\", \"You’re\", \"She’ll\", \"You’ll\", \"I’d\", \"There’ll\", \"She’d\", \"She’ll\",

apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n\n- There are True examples that do NOT contain a contraction ending with 't, e.g. \"The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\" (contains \"didn’t\", which fits), but \"The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\" (contains \"wasn’t\", fits), but \"The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\" (contains \"wouldn’t\", fits), but \"The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\" (contains \"wasn’t\", fits), but \"The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\" (contains \"didn’t\", fits), but \"The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\" (contains \"wouldn’t\", fits), but \"The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\" (contains \"couldn’t\", fits), but \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (contains \"I’ve\", not ending in 't), so this does NOT fit Option B.\n\nSo Option B is not correct, because \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" is True, but does not contain a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's check this:\n\n- \"The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\" — contains \"choir’s\" and \"didn’t\" (both have internal apostrophes).\n- \"We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\" — contains \"We’d\" and \"plane’s\".\n- \"They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\" — contains \"They’ll\" and \"ship’s\".\n- \"The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\" — contains \"coach’s\" and \"wouldn’t\".\n- \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" — contains \"There’s\" and \"painter’s\".\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" — contains \"I’ve\" and \"gardener’s\".\n\nAll True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"She opened the window to let in a breeze.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"He set an alarm for six in the morning.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"The bus stops near the art studio.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n\nNone of the False examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\n\"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\"\n\n- \"We’ve\" (W-e-’v-e) — internal apostrophe between e and v.\n- \"children’s\" (c-h-i-l-d-r-e-n-’s) — internal apostrophe between n and s.\n\nSo, this fits Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- The kettle whistled from the stove.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- True examples often have \"didn't\", \"wasn't\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\n- Many True examples contain possessives (e.g., \"the host’s table\", \"the engine’s rumble\", \"the team’s bus\", \"everyone’s input\", \"my friend’s carpool\", \"the island’s ferry\", \"today’s ticket\", \"the hotel’s lobby\", \"the scouts’ leader\", \"the trail’s marker\", \"the camp’s lights\", \"the train’s departure\", \"the manager’s keys\", \"the stadium’s lock\", \"the poet’s odes\", \"her editor’s favorite\", \"the park’s fountain\", \"the knight’s honor\", \"the town’s centennial\", \"the city’s buses\", \"the doctor’s report\", \"his father’s watch\", \"tomorrow’s interview\", \"the cat’s collar\", \"the owner’s address\", \"the artist’s work\", \"the gallery’s theme\", \"the gardener’s invoice\", \"a baker’s dozen\", \"children’s seats\", \"Sofia’s recipe\", \"baker’s yeast\", \"the mayor’s aide\", \"the choir’s robes\", \"tonight’s service\", \"the village’s well\", \"the mayor’s office\", \"citizens’ emails\", \"the toddler’s snacks\", \"dad’s umbrella\", \"the pilot’s seat\", \"Alex’s height\", \"the lion’s roar\", \"the keeper’s horse\", \"the farmer’s field\", \"Poe’s tales\", \"today’s news\", \"Dad’s car\").\n- Many of these are possessive forms, which always have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- Some True examples also contain contractions (e.g., \"We’re\", \"You’re\", \"It’s\", \"We’ll\", \"You’ll\", \"I’ve\", \"She’ll\", \"He’s\", \"It’ll\", \"I’d\", \"can’t\"), which also have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\n- Only a few True examples contain such contractions: \"can’t\", \"won’t\", \"isn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"aren’t\", \"doesn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wasn’t\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? Let's check a few:\n  - \"wouldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"couldn’t\" — Yes, many do.\n  - But also: \"We’d\", \"I’ll\", \"We’ve\", \"You’d\", \"You’ve\", \"There’ll\", \"You’ll\" — These are contractions, but do not end with 't.\n  - So Option B is too narrow; it would not accept \"We’d\", \"I’ll\", \"We’ve\", etc.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?\n  - \"region’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"bird’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"knight’s\", \"couldn’t\", \"library’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"brewer’s\", \"didn’t\", \"choir’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"program’s\", \"We’d\", \"doctor’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"teacher’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"I’ll\", \"pilot’s\", \"student’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"lab’s\", \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"didn’t\", \"traveler’s\", \"broker’s\", \"isn’t\", \"You’d\", \"they’d\", \"didn’t\", \"director’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"festival’s\", \"We’ve\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\", \"park’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"cat’s\", \"didn’t\", \"owner’s\", \"mayor’s\", \"she’d\", \"island’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"We’ll\", \"Julie’s\", \"manager’s\", \"didn’t\", \"stadium’s\", \"editor’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\", \"That chef’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"castle’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"river’s\", \"shouldn’t\", \"scouts’\", \"couldn’t\", \"trail’s\", \"There’ll\", \"harbor’s\", \"You’ll\", \"train’s\".\n  - All of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n- Do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No. None of the False examples have such a word.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\"\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be False.\n\nNow, which rule is correct? Option A is correct, because Option B is too narrow and does not account for all the True examples.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the new text step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look for patterns in the True examples:\n\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- He balanced the tray with one hand.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending in 't: wouldn't, didn't, wasn't, couldn't, weren't, doesn't, won't, etc.\n- However, some True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't, e.g., \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\" is \"we have\", not ending in 't), \"He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\" (\"He’s\" is \"he is\", not ending in 't), \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (\"There’s\" is \"there is\"), \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" is \"of the clock\", not a contraction ending in 't).\n\nSo Option A cannot be the rule, because there are True examples that do not have a contraction ending in 't.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n\n- Option B says: the string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- Let's look at the True examples: \"children’s\", \"farmer’s\", \"doctor’s\", \"baby’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"editor’s\", \"Poe’s\", \"student’s\", \"lab’s\", \"village’s\", \"baker’s\", \"week’s\", \"gardener’s\", \"choir’s\", \"baker’s\", \"artist’s\", \"pilot’s\", \"sister’s\", \"cat’s\", \"island’s\", \"manager’s\", \"stadium’s\", \"plane’s\", \"o’clock\", \"author’s\", \"book’s\", \"Sofia’s\", \"baker’s\", \"actor’s\", \"choir’s\", \"poet’s\", \"knight’s\", \"weatherman’s\", \"cat’s\", \"coach’s\", etc.\n- All of these have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive 's, contractions like \"I’ve\", \"We’ve\", \"He’s\", \"She’d\", \"You’ll\", \"It’d\", \"At five o’clock\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: \"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\" No internal apostrophe. \"The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\" No internal apostrophe. \"The power lines buzzed in the heat.\" No internal apostrophe. And so on.\n\nSo, Option B fits all the True and False examples.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nHe’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n\n- \"He’s\" (he is) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"printer’s\" (possessive) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"wasn’t\" (was not) has an internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, the new text contains multiple words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No. For example, \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" contains \"He’ll\" and \"father’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" contains \"You’ve\" and \"mechanic’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\" contains \"We’ll\", \"farmer’s\", and \"it’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n  - \"camp’s\" (c a m p ’ s)\n  - \"library’s\" (l i b r a r y ’ s)\n  - \"knight’s\" (k n i g h t ’ s)\n  - \"children’s\" (c h i l d r e n ’ s)\n  - \"baker’s\" (b a k e r ’ s)\n  - \"artist’s\" (a r t i s t ’ s)\n  - \"region’s\" (r e g i o n ’ s)\n  - \"father’s\" (f a t h e r ’ s)\n  - \"editor’s\" (e d i t o r ’ s)\n  - \"neighbor’s\" (n e i g h b o r ’ s)\n  - \"dancer’s\" (d a n c e r ’ s)\n  - \"storm’s\" (s t o r m ’ s)\n  - \"sailor’s\" (s a i l o r ’ s)\n  - \"teacher’s\" (t e a c h e r ’ s)\n  - \"mechanic’s\" (m e c h a n i c ’ s)\n  - \"lion’s\" (l i o n ’ s)\n  - \"keeper’s\" (k e e p e r ’ s)\n  - \"lab’s\" (l a b ’ s)\n  - \"gardener’s\" (g a r d e n e r ’ s)\n  - \"printer’s\" (p r i n t e r ’ s)\n  - \"ranger’s\" (r a n g e r ’ s)\n  - \"hikers’\" (h i k e r s ’)\n  - \"farmer’s\" (f a r m e r ’ s)\n  - \"today’s\" (t o d a y ’ s)\n  - \"gallery’s\" (g a l l e r y ’ s)\n  - \"issue\" (no apostrophe, but \"editor’s\" is present)\n  - \"invoice\" (no apostrophe, but \"gardener’s\" is present)\n  - \"routine\" (no apostrophe, but \"dancer’s\" is present)\n  - \"theme\" (no apostrophe, but \"artist’s\" is present)\n  - \"field\" (no apostrophe, but \"farmer’s\" is present)\n  - \"practice\" (no apostrophe, but \"week’s\" is present)\n  - \"week’s\" (w e e k ’ s)\n  - \"plants\" (no apostrophe, but \"neighbor’s\" is present)\n  - \"radios\" (no apostrophe, but \"hikers’\" is present)\n  - \"results\" (no apostrophe, but \"lab’s\" is present)\n  - \"invoice\" (no apostrophe, but \"gardener’s\" is present)\n  - \"error\" (no apostrophe, but \"printer’s\" is present)\n  - \"advice\" (no apostrophe, but \"teacher’s\" is present)\n  - \"watch\" (no apostrophe, but \"father’s\" is present)\n  - \"journal\" (no apostrophe, but \"sailor’s\" is present)\n  - \"routine\" (no apostrophe, but \"dancer’s\" is present)\n  - \"plants\" (no apostrophe, but \"neighbor’s\" is present)\n  - \"field\" (no apostrophe, but \"farmer’s\" is present)\n  - \"warning\" (no apostrophe, but \"ranger’s\" is present)\n  - \"radios\" (no apostrophe, but \"hikers’\" is present)\n  - \"invoice\" (no apostrophe, but \"gardener’s\" is present)\n  - \"error\" (no apostrophe, but \"printer’s\" is present)\n  - \"practice\" (no apostrophe, but \"week’s\" is present)\n  - \"routine\" (no apostrophe, but \"dancer’s\" is present)\n  - \"plants\" (no apostrophe, but \"neighbor’s\" is present)\n  - \"field\" (no apostrophe, but \"farmer’s\" is present)\n\nSo, every True example contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, usually a possessive (’s or s’), or a contraction (like \"He’ll\", \"We’ve\", \"You’ve\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\"\n\n- \"She's\" (S h e ' s) contains an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"brother's\" (b r o t h e r ' s) also contains an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this string should be accepted.\n\nSo, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(we’ve)\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine. (you’re)\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails. (they’ll)\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back. (she’ll)\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call. (we’ll)\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient. (you’ll)\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service. (didn’t)\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush. (wasn’t)\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late. (it’s, don’t)\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed. (I’m, wasn’t)\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time. (they’d)\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview. (he’ll)\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (didn’t)\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast. (doesn’t)\n\nSo, some True examples have contractions that do not end in 't (e.g., I’m, you’re, we’ve, they’ll, she’ll, etc.), but all True examples have at least one contraction.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples. Do any of them have contractions? No, none of the False examples have contractions.\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\nThere’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n\nDoes it have a contraction? Yes: \"There’s\" (there is).\n\nDoes it have a contraction ending in 't? No.\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Yes: \"There’s\" and \"baker’s\".\n\nBut, in the True examples, \"The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\" is True, but it contains both \"baker’s\" and \"wasn’t\". The \"wasn’t\" is a contraction ending in 't.\n\nBut in the new text, \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\", there is only \"There’s\" and \"baker’s\", but no contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, let's look at Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n\"baker’s\" fits this, as does \"There’s\".\n\nBut in the False examples, \"I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\" does not have any apostrophes, so that's fine. But let's check if any False examples have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLooking at the False examples, none of them have any apostrophes at all.\n\nBut in the True examples, all of them have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (e.g., \"wouldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"baker’s\", \"there’s\", \"I’m\", \"you’re\", etc.).\n\nSo, Option B seems to fit all the True examples and none of the False examples.\n\nOption A is too restrictive, as some True examples have contractions that do not end in 't (e.g., \"I’m\", \"you’re\", \"we’ve\", \"they’ll\", etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

(o’clock)\n  - She’s bringing her brother’s guitar to the show. (She’s, brother’s)\n  - I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (I’ve, gardener’s)\n  - He’s improved since last week’s practice. (He’s, week’s)\n  - The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls. (mayor’s, she’d)\n  - The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all. (bird’s, wasn’t)\n  - The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite. (poet’s, weren’t, editor’s)\n  - The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (child’s, didn’t, grandma’s)\n  - The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths. (festival’s, didn’t, vendors’)\n  - The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge. (team’s, couldn’t)\n  - The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end. (author’s, wasn’t, book’s)\n  - The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly. (library’s, weren’t)\n  - The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue. (editor’s, wasn’t, today’s)\n  - The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (park’s, wasn’t)\n  - The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays. (broker’s, isn’t)\n  - I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (I’ve, gardener’s)\n  - The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all. (bird’s, wasn’t)\n  - I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed. (I’m, baby’s, wasn’t)\n  - You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (You’d, cat’s)\n  - She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready. (She’ll, lab’s, she’s)\n  - We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready. (We’re, host’s, isn’t)\n  - That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu. (chef’s, wasn’t, tonight’s)\n  - We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call. (We’ll, everyone’s, Friday’s)\n  - He’s improved since last week’s practice. (He’s, week’s)\n  - You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (You’ve, mechanic’s)\n  - I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news. (I’d, Poe’s, today’s)\n  - He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants. (He’d, neighbor’s)\n  - The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring. (river’s, shouldn’t)\n\nBut in many of these, the only word with an apostrophe is a possessive (e.g., \"brother’s\", \"gardener’s\", \"cat’s\", \"lab’s\", \"host’s\", \"chef’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"Friday’s\", \"week’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"Poe’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"river’s\"). These are not contractions ending in 't.\n\nTherefore, Option B is too narrow and does not fit all True examples.\n\nOption A, however, fits: every True example contains at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, or other forms like \"o’clock\").\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nBright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No, it does not.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

the veranda.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- The printer jammed halfway through

folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending in 't: doesn't, isn't, wasn't, didn't, wouldn't, weren't, can't, won't, couldn't, etc.\n- But there are also True examples like \"She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\" (She’s, county’s), \"They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\" (They’ll), \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (O’Malley’s), \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" (barista’s), \"The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\" (manager’s, stadium’s), etc.\n- These have possessives or contractions not ending in 't (She’s = she is, They’ll = they will, O’Malley’s = possessive, barista’s = possessive, manager’s = possessive, etc.)\n\nSo Option A cannot be correct, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n- Let's check: \"She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\" (She’s, county’s, doesn’t) -- all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\" (They’ll, ship’s, engine) -- They’ll and ship’s have internal apostrophes.\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (O’Malley’s) -- O’Malley’s has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" (barista’s, didn’t, Maya’s) -- all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\" (manager’s, didn’t, stadium’s) -- all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\" (cat’s, didn’t) -- both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (poet’s, weren’t, editor’s) -- all have internal apostrophes.\n\nNow, let's check a False example: \"The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\" -- no internal apostrophe.\nAnother: \"A violin solo echoed through the hall.\" -- no internal apostrophe.\nAnother: \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" -- no internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, Option B fits all the True and False examples.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nThe engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Yes: \"engine’s\" and \"wasn’t\" both have internal apostrophes.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A:\n- Many True examples have words like \"author’s\", \"book’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"choir’s\", \"Claire’s\", \"twins’\", \"weatherman’s\", \"child’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\", \"doctor’s\", \"region’s\", \"storm’s\", \"island’s\", \"knight’s\", \"city’s\", \"baby’s\", \"printer’s\", \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\", \"brother's\", \"bird’s\", \"children’s\", \"sister’s\", \"festival’s\", \"vendors’\", \"vineyard’s\", \"ship’s\", \"manager’s\", \"stadium’s\", \"dog’s\", \"shelter’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"someone’s\", \"team’s\", \"broker’s\", \"Monday’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"Friday’s\", \"brewer’s\", \"poet’s\", \"editor’s\", \"park’s\", \"fountain wasn’t\".\n- All of these have an internal apostrophe between two letters, often indicating possession or contraction.\n\nOption B:\n- The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (can't, won't, didn't, etc.).\n- Many True examples do have \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"weren’t\", \"wasn’t\", etc.\n- However, there are also True examples that do NOT have a contraction ending in 't, such as \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\", \"She’s bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\", \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\", \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\", \"The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\" (this one does have \"isn't\"), \"We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\", \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (this one does have \"weren't\"), etc.\n\nBut, crucially, there are True examples that do NOT have a contraction ending in 't, but do have a possessive with an apostrophe (e.g., \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\").\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\n\"That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\"\n\n- \"chef’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n- \"wasn’t\" (contraction ending in 't)\n- \"tonight’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, both Option A and Option B would accept this string, but the rule that fits all the True examples is Option A, because some True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't, but all have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- The kettle whistled from the

Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's check if Option B fits:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending in 't (wasn't, didn't, couldn't, wouldn't, isn't, etc.).\n- However, there are also True examples with other contractions: There’ll, He’ll, I’d, I’ve, You’re, It’s, She’d, We’ll, etc.\n- There are also True examples with possessives: the poet’s line, the museum’s café, the island’s ferry, the chef’s risotto, the baker’s dozen, the hotel’s lobby, the painter’s signature, Grandma’s pie, Mom’s, Julie’s notes, the train’s departure, the cat’s collar, the owner’s address, everyone’s input, the toddler’s snacks, dad’s umbrella, father’s watch, Alex’s height, the camp’s lights, the cat’s whiskers, the choir’s robes, the farmer’s field, her sister’s letter, the gardener’s invoice, the manager’s keys, the stadium’s lock, the engine’s rumble, the scouts’ leader, the trail’s marker, my friend’s carpool, the editor’s note.\n\nSo, Option B is too narrow, because it would only accept sentences with contractions ending in 't, but many True examples have other contractions or possessives.\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\n- This fits all the True examples: every True example contains at least one word with an internal apostrophe (contractions like \"isn't\", \"didn't\", \"he'll\", \"I've\", \"you're\", \"it's\", \"we'll\", \"she'd\", \"there'll\", \"couldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"wasn't\", \"didn't\", \"isn't\", \"I've\", \"I'd\", \"you're\", \"we've\", \"she'd\", \"he's\", \"he'll\", \"we're\", \"my friend's\", \"the poet’s\", \"the museum’s\", \"the island’s\", \"the chef’s\", \"the baker’s\", \"the hotel’s\", \"the painter’s\", \"Grandma’s\", \"Mom’s\", \"Julie’s\", \"the train’s\", \"the cat’s\", \"the owner’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"the toddler’s\", \"dad’s\", \"father’s\", \"Alex’s\", \"the camp’s\", \"the cat’s\", \"the choir’s\", \"the farmer’s\", \"her sister’s\", \"the gardener’s\", \"the manager’s\", \"the stadium’s\", \"the engine’s\", \"the scouts’\", \"the trail’s\", \"my friend’s\", \"the editor’s\").\n- The False examples do not contain any word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"I found a shell shaped like a heart.\"\n\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be classified as False.\n\nSo, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- A tall fence surrounds the

thumb drive.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A: Contractions ending with 't (e.g., didn't, wasn't, wouldn't, isn't, couldn't, weren't, hadn't, etc.)\n\n- Many True examples contain \"didn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"isn't\", \"couldn't\", \"weren't\", \"hadn't\", etc.\n- However, some True examples do NOT have a contraction ending in 't, e.g., \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There'll\" and \"baker's\", \"market's\" but not ending in 't), \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" (\"He'll\", \"father's\", \"tomorrow's\"), \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (\"She's\", \"she'd\"), \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (\"They're\", \"town's\").\n- So, Option A does not fit all True examples.\n\nOption B: Contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n- \"I'm\", \"I'll\", \"he's\", \"she's\", \"they're\", \"we'll\", \"didn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"isn't\", \"couldn't\", \"weren't\", \"hadn't\", \"there'll\", \"she'd\", \"he'll\", \"it's\", \"you're\", \"dad's\", \"pilot's\", \"artist's\", \"library's\", \"broker's\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples have contractions ending in 't: didn't, doesn't, wasn't, wouldn't, shouldn't, isn't, etc.\n- But there are also True examples with other contractions: He’d, She’s, You’ve, We’ll, There’s, It’d, etc.\n- So Option A would not explain all the True examples, because some True examples have contractions that do not end in 't.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n\n- All True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe: it’s, city’s, buses, don’t, cat’s, didn’t, he’d, neighbor’s, company’s, didn’t, year’s, you’ve, mechanic’s, Sofia’s, doesn’t, baker’s, you’d, they’d, didn’t, don’t, today’s, you’ll, she’s, she’d, planned, he’ll, father’s, tomorrow’s, barista’s, didn’t, Maya’s, he’s, printer’s, wasn’t, festival’s, vendors’, baker’s, wasn’t, it’s, supposed, park’s, wasn’t, coach’s, wouldn’t, she’d, sister’s, Claire’s, cousin, twins’, we’ll, farmer’s, it’s, they’ll, ship’s, grandma’s, mom’s, you’d, cat’s, we’d, plane’s, manager’s, keys, stadium’s, she’s, county’s, doesn’t, it’d, weatherman’s, forecast, weren’t, choir’s, director, didn’t, there’s, painter’s, river’s, shouldn’t, spring.\n\n- All False examples lack any word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, the new text is:\n\nShe folded a paper crane at her desk.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe?

No apostrophes.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- A low hum vibrated through the cabin.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n  - No apostrophes.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n  - No apostrophes.\n\nNow, let's check for any False examples that do have apostrophes:\n\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n  - \"hosts\" is not a contraction or possessive, just a verb.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n  - No apostrophe.\n\nSo, all False examples lack apostrophes.\n\nNow, let's check if all True examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (i.e., not at the start or end, but between two letters). For example, \"wasn’t\", \"She’s\", \"editor’s\", \"chef’s\", etc.\n\nAlso, let's check if all True examples have a contraction ending with 't (Option B). For example, \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"doesn’t\", \"weren’t\", \"won’t\".\n\nBut, some True examples have only possessives or contractions not ending in 't:\n\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n  - \"She’s\" (is), \"she’d\" (would/had).\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n  - \"I’ve\" (have), \"gardener’s\" (possessive).\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n  - \"She’d\" (would/had), \"sister’s\" (possessive).\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n  - \"We’ll\" (will), \"Julie’s\" (possessive), \"tomorrow’s\" (possessive).\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n  - \"There’s\" (is), \"painter’s\" (possessive).\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n  - \"I’d\" (would/had), \"Poe’s\" (possessive), \"today’s\" (possessive).\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n  - \"He’ll\" (will), \"he’s\" (is), \"he’s\" (is).\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n  - \"I’ll\" (will), \"pilot’s\" (possessive), \"I’m\" (am).\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n  - \"mayor’s\" (possessive), \"she’d\" (would/had).\n\nThese do not have a contraction ending in 't, so Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nBut all True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (either a contraction or a possessive).\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- She folded a paper crane at her desk.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- True examples: Many of them have contractions ending in 't (wasn't, didn't, couldn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, etc.), but some True examples do not have such contractions, e.g., \"We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\" (no 't contraction), \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (has \"weren't\"), \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\" (no 't contraction), \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (no 't contraction), etc.\n- False examples: Some have no contractions at all, which fits, but let's check if any False example has a contraction ending in 't. None seem to.\n\nBut, crucially, many True examples are accepted even though they do not have a contraction ending in 't. So Option A is too narrow.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n- Let's check: \"We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\" has \"We’ll\", \"farmer’s\", \"it’s\" — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" has \"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\".\n- \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\" has \"He’d\", \"neighbor’s\".\n- \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" has \"They’re\", \"town’s\".\n- \"The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\" has \"team’s\", \"couldn’t\".\n- \"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\" has \"It’s\", \"city’s\", \"don’t\".\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, False examples:\n\n- \"A tall fence surrounds the garden.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"A bicycle bell rang behind me.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The printer jammed halfway through the report.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"He folded a map and put it away.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"I found a shell shaped like a heart.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"My watch beeped right on the hour.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The statue gleamed in the noon light.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We shared a taxi to the train station.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The power lines buzzed in the heat.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"She folded a paper crane at her desk.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The museum was closed for renovation.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We toured the castle under a gray sky.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"She lit a candle on the balcony.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"A sudden gust blew the door open.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"She found a seat near the back.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"He poured tea and set out three cups.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"He copied the file to a thumb drive.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We waved to the ferry from the pier.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The dog chased its tail in circles.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The pie on the counter smells amazing.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We heard laughter from the open doorway.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The choir performed a new arrangement.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"The river flooded after three days of rain.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"She drove along the coast with the windows down.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"We hiked until the path disappeared.\" — no apostrophe.\n- \"A violin solo echoed through the hall.\" — no apostrophe.\n\nSo, Option B fits all the data: True if there is a word with an internal apostrophe, False otherwise.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nA child waved from the bus window.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe? No.\n\nTherefore, the answer is False.\n\nNow, for the rule selection:\n\nOption A is too narrow and does not fit all True examples.\nOption B fits all True and False examples.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No. For example, \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" contains \"he’ll\" and \"he’s\", but not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\" contains \"There’ll\", not a contraction ending with 't.\n- \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" contains \"O’Malley’s\", which is a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?

Do any of them contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check a few:\n\n- \"She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"She opened the window to let in a breeze.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"I found a shell shaped like a heart.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The pie on the counter smells amazing.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\" — No apostrophes.\n\nNone of the False examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\n\"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\"\n\nLet's check for words with an internal apostrophe between two letters:\n\n- \"It’s\" — Yes, between t and s.\n- \"city’s\" — Yes, between y and s.\n- \"don’t\" — Yes, between n and t.\n\nSo, the new text fits Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- The student’s thesis

I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- He balanced the tray with one hand.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A: Only accepts sentences with contractions ending in 't (can't, won't, didn't, isn't, wasn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, etc.)\n\nOption B: Accepts any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe (e.g., can't, won't, didn't, isn't, wasn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, I'm, you're, it's, she's, he's, etc., as well as possessives like the cat's, the dog's, the artist’s, etc.)\n\nLooking at the True examples, many of them have possessives (the camp’s, the county’s, the host’s, the writer’s, the farmer’s, the painter’s, the lion’s, the keeper’s, the baby’s, the actor’s, the children’s, the pilot’s, the poet’s, the editor’s, the park’s, the dog’s, the shelter’s, the director’s, the festival’s, the dancer’s, the sailor’s, the knight’s, the clock’s, the engine’s, etc.), not just contractions ending in 't.\n\nAlso, there are True examples with contractions that do not end in 't, such as:\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n\nTherefore, Option A is too restrictive.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, would accept any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe, which matches all the True examples (since they all have at least one word with an internal apostrophe, either a contraction or a possessive).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n\n- \"coach’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n- \"wouldn’t\" (contraction ending in 't, internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, this sentence contains words with internal apostrophes.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the

her brother's guitar to the show.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- It’s raining

artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- He balanced the tray with one hand.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading

an hour.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n\nNow, let's look at the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A:\n- Many True examples have words like \"didn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"wasn’t\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\n\nNow, the False examples:\n\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- Coffee spilled onto the wooden floor.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? No. For example, \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (\"He’s\" is \"he is\", not ending with 't.) \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (\"O’Malley’s\" is a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't.) \"The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\" (Only \"wasn’t\" fits, but \"author’s\" and \"book’s\" are possessives.)\n- Are all False examples lacking a contraction ending with 't? Yes, but so do many True examples.\n\nOption A:\n- Do all True examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"He’d\" (He + 'd)\n    - \"neighbor’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"vineyard’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"isn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"poet’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"dancer’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wouldn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"O’Malley’s\" (O’Malley + 's)\n    - \"city’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"He’s\" (He + 's)\n    - \"week’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"author’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"book’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"choir’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"director\" (no apostrophe, but \"choir’s\" does)\n    - \"didn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"ship’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"engine\" (no apostrophe, but \"ship’s\" does)\n    - \"printer’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"error\" (no apostrophe, but \"printer’s\" does)\n    - \"pianist’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"couldn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"baby’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"blanket\" (no apostrophe, but \"baby’s\" does)\n    - \"today’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"ticket\" (no apostrophe, but \"today’s\" does)\n    - \"company’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"board\" (no apostrophe, but \"company’s\" does)\n    - \"year’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"lion’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"keeper’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"horse\" (no apostrophe, but \"keeper’s\" does)\n    - \"brewer’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"stout\" (no apostrophe, but \"brewer’s\" does)\n    - \"everyone’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"He’ll\" (He + 'll)\n    - \"father’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"tomorrow’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"She’s\" (She + 's)\n    - \"brother's\" (possessive)\n    - \"mayor’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"citizens’\" (possessive, plural)\n    - \"artist’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"gallery’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"teacher’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"Julie’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"notes\" (no apostrophe, but \"Julie’s\" does)\n    - \"You’d\" (You + 'd)\n    - \"cat’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"park’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"fountain\" (no apostrophe, but \"park’s\" does)\n    - \"Sofia’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"baker’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"yeast\" (no apostrophe, but \"baker’s\" does)\n    - \"editor’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"today’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"It’ll\" (It + 'll)\n    - \"Dad’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"bird’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (contraction)\n    - \"Poe’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"today’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"There’ll\" (There + 'll)\n    - \"baker’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"market’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"storm’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"island’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"shouldn’t\" (contraction)\n\nAll True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (either a contraction or a possessive or a name like O’Malley’s).\n\nNow, the False examples: None of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No.\n\nDoes it contain a contraction ending with 't? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, it would be False.

Since Option A covers all True and False examples, but Option B does not (since \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" is True but does not have a contraction ending with 't), Option A is the correct rule.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The cinema reopened with a classic film.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption B would mean only sentences with contractions ending in 't (like can't, won't, didn't, shouldn't, etc.) are True.\n\nBut in the True examples, we see sentences like:\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late. (You’ll, train’s, you’re)\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard. (I’ll, pilot’s, I’m)\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner. (There’ll, baker’s, market’s)\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s. (Grandma’s, isn’t, Mom’s)\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse. (poet’s, wasn’t)\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker. (scouts’, couldn’t, trail’s)\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants. (He’d, neighbor’s)\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage. (We’ve, children’s)\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end. (author’s, wasn’t, book’s)\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap. (cat’s, didn’t)\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry. (He’s, village’s, won’t)\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign. (engine’s, wasn’t)\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere. (I’ve, gardener’s)\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine. (You’re, hotel’s, lobby)\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations. (barista’s, didn’t, Maya’s)\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste. (brewer’s, didn’t, everyone’s)\n\nSo, many True examples have possessives (’s), not just contractions ending in 't. Also, some have contractions like \"I’ll\", \"He’d\", \"We’ve\", \"You’re\", \"I’m\", \"There’ll\", \"isn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"won’t\", \"didn’t\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n- Please submit the form before Friday afternoon.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- The power came back after midnight.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- \"can't\", \"won't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"couldn't\", \"weren't\", \"didn't\", \"doesn't\", \"hasn't\", \"haven't\", \"hadn't\", \"mustn't\", \"needn't\", \"mightn't\", \"shan't\" are all contractions ending with 't.\n- But in the True examples, we also see \"I’m\", \"We’ll\", \"We’d\", \"It’s\", \"She’ll\", \"There’ll\", \"We’ve\", \"There’s\", \"You’re\", \"It’d\", etc., which are contractions but do not end with 't.\n- So Option A cannot be correct, because many True examples have contractions that do not end with 't.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n\n- Option B says: the string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"can't\", \"won't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"couldn't\", \"weren't\", \"didn't\", \"doesn't\", \"hasn't\", \"haven't\", \"hadn't\", \"mustn't\", \"needn't\", \"mightn't\", \"shan't\" all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"I’m\", \"We’ll\", \"We’d\", \"It’s\", \"She’ll\", \"There’ll\", \"We’ve\", \"There’s\", \"You’re\", \"It’d\" all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"Julie’s\", \"plane’s\", \"library’s\", \"company’s\", \"director’s\", \"train’s\", \"lab’s\", \"friend’s\", \"baker’s\", \"vineyard’s\", \"child’s\", \"engine’s\", \"city’s\", \"writer’s\", \"market’s\", \"brewer’s\", \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\", \"river’s\", \"park’s\", \"ship’s\", \"team’s\", \"children’s\", \"festival’s\", \"vendors’\", \"painter’s\", \"cat’s\", \"hotel’s\", \"pianist’s\", \"weatherman’s\" all have internal apostrophes (possessive or contraction).\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe? No. None of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nHe’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n\n- \"He’ll\" (He + will) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"he’s\" (he + is) has an internal apostrophe, twice.\n\nSo, according to Option B, this should be accepted.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Let's check a few:\n  - The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste. (didn’t: yes)\n  - The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.

Therefore, Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nNow, let's check Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's look at the True examples again:\n\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste. (brewer’s, everyone’s, didn’t: all have internal apostrophes)\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths. (festival’s, vendors’)\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.

(We’d, plane’s)\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed. (We’ll, farmer’s, it’s)\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails. (mayor’s, wasn’t, citizens’)\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms. (island’s, wouldn’t)\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move. (I’m, clock’s, didn’t)\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (child’s, grandma’s, didn’t)\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all. (bird’s, wasn’t)\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage. (We’ve, children’s)\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.

(Don’t, today’s, you’ll)\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late. (It’s, city’s, don’t)\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague. (It’d, weatherman’s, weren’t)\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index. (choir’s, wasn’t, program’s)\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (e.g., \"brewer’s\", \"didn’t\", \"I’ve\", \"Julie’s\", \"O’Malley’s\", \"She’d\", \"wasn’t\", \"doesn’t\", \"They’d\", \"We’ll\", \"mayor’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"clock’s\", \"child’s\", \"bird’s\", \"We’ve\", \"engine’s\", \"You’d\", \"they’d\", \"didn’t\", \"She's\", \"brother's\", \"He’ll\", \"he’s\", \"Don’t\", \"today’s\", \"you’ll\", \"It’s\", \"city’s\", \"don’t\", \"It’d\", \"weatherman’s\", \"weren’t\", \"choir’s\", \"program’s\").\n\nNow, let's check the False examples. Do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check a few:\n\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly. (no apostrophes)\n- He poured tea and set out three cups. (no apostrophes)\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh. (no apostrophes)\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight. (no apostrophes)\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon. (no apostrophes)\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic. (no apostrophes)\n- The bus stops near the art studio.

(no apostrophes)\n- We shared a taxi to the train station. (no apostrophes)\n\nNone of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nI’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n\n- \"I’m\" (apostrophe between I and m)\n- \"vineyard’s\" (apostrophe between d and s)\n- \"isn’t\" (apostrophe between n and t)\n\nAll three words have internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Many of them have no apostrophes at all, and none have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nBut, crucially, many True examples do NOT have a contraction ending with 't, but do have a possessive or other word with an internal apostrophe (e.g., She’s, O’Malley’s, They’re, He’ll, etc.).\n\nSo, Option B (contraction ending with 't) is too narrow. There are many True examples that do not have such a contraction, but do have a possessive or other word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, fits all True examples: every True example contains at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, O’Malley’s, etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n\n- lion’s: possessive, internal apostrophe\n- didn’t: contraction ending with 't\n- keeper’s: possessive, internal apostrophe\n\nSo, it contains multiple words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

(no apostrophe)\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence. (no apostrophe)\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes. (no apostrophe)\n- The yogurt expired two days ago. (no apostrophe)\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door. (no apostrophe)\n- We rented a cabin near the falls. (no apostrophe)\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.

(no apostrophe)\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement. (no apostrophe)\n- He balanced the tray with one hand. (no apostrophe)\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit. (no apostrophe)\n- The bus stops near the art studio. (no apostrophe)\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun. (no apostrophe)\n\nNow, let's check the rules:\n\nOption A: Accepts any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (e.g., \"didn’t\", \"manager’s\", \"I’ll\", \"He’s\", \"cat’s\", \"they’d\", \"won’t\", etc.)\n\nOption B: Accepts only contractions ending with 't (e.g., \"didn’t\", \"shouldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"don’t\", \"won’t\", \"can’t\", etc.)\n\nBut in the True examples, there are many sentences that are True but do NOT contain a contraction ending in 't, for example:\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard. (\"I’ll\", \"pilot’s\", \"I’m\" — none end in 't)\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview. (\"He’ll\", \"father’s\", \"tomorrow’s\")\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish. (\"There’s\", \"painter’s\")\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year. (\"She’s\", \"she’d\" — only \"she’d\" ends in 'd)\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (\"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\")\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker. (\"scouts’\", \"couldn’t\", \"trail’s\" — only \"couldn’t\" ends in 't, but \"scouts’\" and \"trail’s\" are possessives)\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations. (\"barista’s\", \"didn’t\", \"Maya’s\")\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address. (\"cat’s\", \"didn’t\", \"owner’s\")\n\nSo, Option B is too restrictive. Option A fits all the True examples, as every True example contains at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n\nThere is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be False.\n\nNow, the question is: which rule explains the examples?

No. For example, \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (\"she’s\" and \"she’d\" are contractions, but \"she’s\" does not end with 't).\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" is not a contraction ending with 't).\n- \"I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\" (\"I’ll\" and \"I’m\" do not end with 't).\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (\"There’s\" does not end with 't).\n- \"Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\" (\"isn’t\" does end with 't, but \"Claire’s\" and \"twins’\" are possessives).\n\nSo, Option B does not fit all True examples.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?

Do any of them contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No. None of the False examples have any apostrophes at all.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\n\"At five o’clock, the parade began.\"\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Yes: \"o’clock\" (the apostrophe is between \"o\" and \"c\").\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be accepted (True).\n\nOption B would only accept if there is a contraction ending in 't, which is not the case here.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- A blue heron lifted off from the marsh.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- The cinema reopened with a classic film.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The river flooded after three days of rain.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options against the True examples.\n\nOption A: Contractions ending with 't (can't, won't, isn't, wasn't, didn't, wouldn't, couldn't, etc.)\n\n- Many True examples contain \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"didn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"couldn't\", \"weren't\", \"doesn't\", \"shouldn't\", etc.\n- However, some True examples contain \"he's\", \"there'll\", \"they'd\", \"we're\", \"there's\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The engine sputtered and then went quiet.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- We arrived early and found good seats.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- The team gathered around the whiteboard.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? No. For example, \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" contains \"He’s\" and \"printer’s\" and \"wasn’t\". \"He’s\" and \"printer’s\" do not end with 't, but \"wasn’t\" does. But there are other True examples like \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (\"She’s\" and \"she’d\" but not ending with 't). \"I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\" (\"I’ll\" and \"I’m\" do not end with 't). So Option B does not fit all True examples.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n  - \"He’d\" (e’d), \"neighbor’s\" (r’s), \"didn’t\" (n’t), \"You’d\" (u’d), \"cat’s\" (t’s), \"child’s\" (d’s), \"grandma’s\" (a’s), \"island’s\" (d’s), \"wouldn’t\" (n’t), \"He’s\" (e’s), \"printer’s\" (r’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"Sofia’s\" (a’s), \"doesn’t\" (n’t), \"castle’s\" (e’s), \"wouldn’t\" (n’t), \"He’s\" (e’s), \"village’s\" (e’s), \"won’t\" (n’t), \"You’ll\" (u’ll), \"train’s\" (n’s), \"bird’s\" (d’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"He’ll\" (e’ll), \"he’s\" (e’s), \"There’ll\" (e’ll), \"harbor’s\" (r’s), \"We’ll\" (e’ll), \"Julie’s\" (e’s), \"She’s\" (e’s), \"brother’s\" (r’s), \"The broker’s\" (r’s), \"isn’t\" (n’t), \"The teacher’s\" (r’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"We’ll\" (e’ll), \"farmer’s\" (r’s), \"festival’s\" (l’s), \"vendors’\" (s’), \"It wasn’t\" (n’t), \"sailor’s\" (r’s), \"scouts’\" (s’), \"couldn’t\" (n’t), \"trail’s\" (l’s), \"manager’s\" (r’s), \"keys didn’t\" (n’t), \"stadium’s\" (m’s), \"She’s\" (e’s), \"she’d\" (e’d), \"She’ll\" (e’ll), \"writer’s\" (r’s), \"choir’s\" (r’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"program’s\" (m’s), \"I’ll\" (I’ll), \"pilot’s\" (t’s), \"park’s\" (k’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"We’re\" (e’re), \"camp’s\" (p’s), \"won’t\" (n’t), \"You’ve\" (u’ve), \"mechanic’s\" (c’s), \"We’d\" (e’d), \"plane’s\" (e’s), \"I’d\" (I’d), \"Poe’s\" (e’s), \"There’s\" (e’s), \"painter’s\" (r’s), \"director’s\" (r’s), \"wasn’t\" (n’t), \"festival’s\" (l’s), \"I’ve\" (I’ve), \"gardener’s\" (r’s), \"We’d\" (e’d), \"doctor’s\" (r’s), \"wouldn’t\" (n’t), \"be delayed\".\n\nAll True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\"I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\"\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

Let's check a few:\n\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock. (didn't)\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse. (didn't)\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be. (wasn't, it's)\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue. (wasn't)\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready. (we're, isn't)\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later. (don't, you'll)\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height. (wasn't)\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned. (couldn't)\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight. (isn't)\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car. (it'll, we're)\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer. (wouldn't)\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s. (isn't)\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish. (there's)\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap. (didn't)\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news. (I'd)\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly. (weren't)\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine. (you're)\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (wasn't)\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side. (shouldn't)\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge. (couldn't)\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed. (I'm, wasn't)\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (you've)\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (you'd)\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move. (I'm, didn't)\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth. (there'll)\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected. (wasn't, I'd)\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails. (they'll)\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants. (he'd)\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget. (didn't)\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out. (she's, doesn't)\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient. (you'll, you're)\n- The cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address. (didn't)\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush. (wasn't)\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (didn't)\n\nSo, many of the True examples do have a contraction ending in 't (didn't, wasn't, couldn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, doesn't, isn't, don't), but there are also True examples with other contractions: it's, we're, you'll, I'd, I'm, you've, you'd, there's, he'll, she'll, etc.\n\nNow, let's check if any False examples have a contraction ending in 't:\n\nLooking at the False examples, none of them have a contraction ending in 't, but also, none of them have any contractions at all.\n\nBut, crucially, some True examples are accepted even when the only contraction is not ending in 't, e.g.:\n\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish. (there's)\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car. (it'll, we're)\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (you've)\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (you'd)\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move. (I'm)\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth. (there'll)\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails. (they'll)\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants. (he'd)\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out. (she's)\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient. (you'll, you're)\n\nSo, Option B is too narrow, because it would not accept sentences with only \"I'm\", \"you're\", \"he'll\", \"she's\", \"there's\", etc., but these are accepted in the True examples.\n\nNow, let's check Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's see if this fits all True examples:\n\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock. (manager’s, didn’t, stadium’s)\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse. (lion’s, didn’t, keeper’s)\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be. (baker’s, wasn’t, it’s)\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue. (editor’s, wasn’t, today’s)\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.

(you’re, hotel’s)\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet. (park’s, wasn’t)\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side. (storm’s, shouldn’t, island’s)\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge. (team’s, couldn’t)\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed. (I’m, baby’s, wasn’t)\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again. (you’ve, mechanic’s)\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb. (you’d, cat’s)\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.

(cat’s, didn’t, owner’s)\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush. (baker’s, wasn’t, today’s)\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge. (child’s, didn’t, grandma’s)\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives like \"manager’s\", contractions like \"didn’t\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?\n\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery. (no)\n- The calendar still shows last month. (no)\n- He balanced the tray with one hand. (no)\n- A low hum vibrated through the cabin. (no)\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- He balanced the tray with one hand.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- The team gathered around the whiteboard.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n\n- Are all True examples containing a contraction ending with 't? No. For example, \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" (\"There’s\" is \"there is\", not ending with 't.)\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (\"I’ve\" is \"I have\", not ending with 't.)\n- \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (\"We’ve\" is \"we have\", not ending with 't.)\n- \"Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\" (\"isn't\" is a contraction ending with 't, but there are other words with apostrophes: \"Grandma’s\", \"Mom’s\".)\n- \"The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\" (\"choir’s\", \"didn’t\", \"tonight’s\" -- so both possessives and contractions.)\n\nSo, Option B does not fit, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't, but do have other words with internal apostrophes (possessives, contractions like \"I've\", etc.).\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n- \"There’s\" (there is), \"painter’s\" (possessive), \"gardener’s\" (possessive), \"I’ve\" (I have), \"toddler’s\" (possessive), \"dad’s\" (possessive), \"Grandma’s\" (possessive), \"Mom’s\" (possessive), \"choir’s\" (possessive), \"didn’t\" (contraction), \"tonight’s\" (possessive), etc.\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He balanced the tray with one hand.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"She found a seat near the back.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"She opened the window to let in a breeze.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"We shared a taxi to the train station.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"She painted a mural on the north wall.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The choir performed a new arrangement.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The pie on the counter smells amazing.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The calendar still shows last month.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"A bicycle bell rang behind me.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"I left the keys on the kitchen table.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He set an alarm for six in the morning.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The team gathered around the whiteboard.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The phone battery died during the call.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He folded a map and put it away.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"A cool mist drifted across the field.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"The bus stops near the art studio.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He poured tea and set out three cups.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"We took the scenic route through the hills.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"He added basil to the simmering sauce.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"My watch beeped right on the hour.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\" No apostrophes.\n- \"She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\" No apostrophes.\n\nSo, Option A fits all the data: True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters; False examples do not.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nThe knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n\n- \"knight’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe between two letters)\n- \"couldn’t\" (contraction, internal apostrophe between two letters)\n\nSo, this text fits Option A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

For example:\n\n- O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew. (No contraction ending in 't, but has O’Malley’s and city’s)\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite. (poet’s, editor’s)\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme. (artist’s, gallery’s)\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays. (broker’s, isn’t)\n\nSo, Option A is too restrictive. Option B is more general and fits all the True examples: they all have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, or names like O’Malley’s).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nClaire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n\n- Claire’s (internal apostrophe between two letters)\n- isn’t (internal apostrophe between two letters)\n- twins’ (apostrophe after s, not between two letters)\n\nSo, Claire’s and isn’t both fit the rule in Option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

For example, \"baker’s\", \"teacher’s\", \"cat’s\", \"festival’s\", \"pilot’s\", \"owner’s\", \"choir’s\", \"baby’s\", \"dog’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"artist’s\", \"sister’s\", \"mayor’s\", \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\", \"hotel’s\", \"gallery’s\", \"editor’s\", \"river’s\", \"scouts’\", \"trail’s\", \"student’s\", \"lab’s\", \"train’s\", \"town’s\", \"plane’s\", \"farmer’s\", \"team’s\", \"someone’s\", \"market’s\", \"camp’s\", \"director’s\", \"festival’s\", \"Alex’s\", \"vendors’\", \"owner’s\", \"tonight’s\", \"today’s\", \"baker’s\", \"today’s\", \"shelter’s\", \"plane’s\", \"town’s\", \"baker’s\", \"gallery’s\", \"sister’s\", \"broker’s\", \"hotel’s\", \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\", \"mayor’s\", \"sailor’s\".\n\nSo, Option A is too restrictive. Option B fits: any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessives, contractions, etc.).\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

No. For example, \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\" is a contraction, but not ending in 't.) \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (\"O’Malley’s\" is a possessive, not a contraction ending in 't.) \"Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\" (\"isn't\" fits, but \"Grandma’s\" and \"Mom’s\" are possessives.) There are many True examples where the only apostrophe is in a possessive or a contraction not ending in 't.\n\n- Are all False examples explained by the absence of a contraction ending in 't? Many False examples have no apostrophes at all, but that's not enough to confirm the rule.\n\nNow, Option A:\n\n- Are all True examples explained by the presence of a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"We’ll\" (We + will, contraction, internal apostrophe)\n    - \"Julie’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n    - \"O’Malley’s\" (internal apostrophe in O’Malley’s)\n    - \"isn’t\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - \"cat’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"wouldn’t\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - \"neighbor’s\" (possessive)\n    - \"I’ve\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - \"There’s\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - \"She’ll\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - \"shouldn’t\" (internal apostrophe)\n    - etc.\n\nAll True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\n- Are all False examples explained by the absence of such a word? Let's check a few:\n    - \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"She lit a candle on the balcony.\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\" (no apostrophe)\n    - \"The soup simmered for an hour.\" (no apostrophe)\n    - etc.\n\nNone of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\"\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, the answer would be False.\n\nNow, which rule is correct? Option A explains all the True and False examples, while Option B does not (since not all True examples have a contraction ending in 't).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (\"He’s\" = \"He is\"), \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (\"I’ve\" = \"I have\"), \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (\"There’s\" = \"There is\"), etc. These do not end with 't.\n- Therefore, Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- Do all True examples contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check:\n    - \"I’d\" (I + 'd)\n    - \"He’d\" (He + 'd)\n    - \"He’s\" (He + 's)\n    - \"You’ll\" (You + 'll)\n    - \"didn’t\" (did + n’t)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"We’ll\" (We + 'll)\n    - \"You’ll\" (You + 'll)\n    - \"isn’t\" (is + n’t)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"couldn’t\" (could + n’t)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"You’ve\" (You + 've)\n    - \"couldn’t\" (could + n’t)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"isn’t\" (is + n’t)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"shouldn’t\" (should + n’t)\n    - \"There’ll\" (There + 'll)\n    - \"wouldn’t\" (would + n’t)\n    - \"didn’t\" (did + n’t)\n    - \"won’t\" (will + n’t)\n    - \"There’s\" (There + 's)\n    - \"They’ll\" (They + 'll)\n    - \"wasn’t\" (was + n’t)\n    - \"shouldn’t\" (should + n’t)\n    - \"I’ve\" (I + 've)\n    - \"o’clock\" (of the clock, contraction)\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\"The power came back after midnight.\"\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No, it does not.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this would be False.\n\nSo, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" contains \"He’ll\" and \"father’s\", but neither ends with 't.\n- \"The engine’s rumble wasn’t a good sign.\" contains \"wasn’t\", which fits, but \"engine’s\" also has an apostrophe.\n- \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" contains \"didn’t\", but also \"barista’s\" and \"Maya’s\".\n- \"The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\" contains \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"didn’t\", \"traveler’s\".\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" contains \"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\".\n\nBut there are True examples that do not have a contraction ending with 't, but do have other apostrophe words:\n- \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" (\"He’ll\", \"father’s\")\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There’ll\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\")\n- \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (\"She’s\", \"she’d\")\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" (\"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\")\n- \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\", \"Julie’s\", \"tomorrow’s\")\n- \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" (\"There’s\", \"painter’s\")\n- \"We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\" (\"We’d\", \"plane’s\")\n- \"The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\" (\"lion’s\", \"didn’t\", \"keeper’s\")\n- \"The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\" (\"pianist’s\", \"couldn’t\")\n- \"The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\" (\"library’s\", \"weren’t\")\n\nSo, Option B is too narrow.

Let's check a few:\n    - \"It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\" (\"It’s\" = it is, \"I’m\" = I am, \"they’re\" = they are) — none end with 't.\n    - \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\" = of the clock) — not a contraction ending with 't.\n    - \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (\"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\") — \"weren’t\" fits, but \"poet’s\" and \"editor’s\" are possessives.\n    - \"The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\" (\"river’s\", \"shouldn’t\") — \"shouldn’t\" fits, but \"river’s\" is possessive.\n\nBut there are True examples that do not have a contraction ending with 't, e.g.:\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (no 't contraction)\n- \"The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\" (\"baker’s\" is possessive, \"wasn’t\" is a contraction ending with 't)\n- \"I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\" (\"I’ll\" = I will, \"pilot’s\" = possessive)\n\nSo, Option B does not fit all True examples, because some True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nLet's check if all True examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters:\n\n- \"The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\" (\"baker’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"it’s\") — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\" (\"It’s\", \"I’m\", \"they’re\") — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (\"o’clock\") — internal apostrophe.\n- \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (\"poet’s\", \"weren’t\", \"editor’s\") — all have internal apostrophes.\n- \"I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\" (\"I’ll\", \"pilot’s\") — both have internal apostrophes.\n- \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (\"We’ve\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\") — all have internal apostrophes.\n\nNow, let's check a False example:\n\n- \"The poet signed books after the talk.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n- \"The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\" — no internal apostrophe.\n\nSo, Option A fits: all True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, and False examples do not.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"He balanced the tray with one hand.\"\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, the answer should be False.\n\nNow, the final instruction is to pick which rule explains the examples, A or B.\n\nOption A is correct.\n\nSo, the JSON response is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

field.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n- I found a shell shaped like a

power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples have contractions ending with 't: don't, didn't, wasn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, can't, isn't, weren't, etc.\n- However, some True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't, for example: \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" (\"There’s\" is \"there is\", not ending with 't), \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (\"O’Malley’s\" is a possessive, not a contraction ending with 't), \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (\"She’d\" is \"she had\" or \"she would\", not ending with 't), \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\" is \"we will\", not ending with 't), \"It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\" (\"It’ll\" is \"it will\", not ending with 't), \"There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\" (\"There’ll\" is \"there will\", not ending with 't).\n\nSo Option A cannot be the rule, because there are True examples that do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- Option B says: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n- Let's check the True examples: All of them have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters: \"don’t\", \"today’s\", \"you’ll\", \"barista’s\", \"didn’t\", \"Maya’s\", \"you’ve\", \"mechanic’s\", \"wrench\", \"choir’s\", \"didn’t\", \"tonight’s\", \"I’m\", \"baby’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"river’s\", \"shouldn’t\", \"it’s\", \"I’m\", \"they’re\", \"she’ll\", \"lab’s\", \"she’s\", \"it’s\", \"city’s\", \"don’t\", \"library’s\", \"weren’t\", \"region’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"ranger’s\", \"didn’t\", \"hikers’\",

\"sister’s\", \"pilot’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"Alex’s\", \"I can't\", \"it's\", \"brewer’s\", \"didn’t\", \"everyone’s\".\n\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: Do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? Let's check a few:\n\n- \"A cool mist drifted across the field.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"She opened the window to let in a breeze.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The poet signed books after the talk.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The yogurt expired two days ago.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Thunder rolled across the valley.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"I found a shell shaped like a heart.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The soup simmered for an hour.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A low hum vibrated through the cabin.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The cinema reopened with a classic film.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A soft humming came from the attic fan.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The dog chased its tail in circles.\" — \"its\" is not a contraction or possessive with an apostrophe.\n- \"The meeting began later than planned.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The bus stops near the art studio.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"He poured tea and set out three cups.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A violin solo echoed through the hall.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"We rented a cabin near the falls.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The kettle whistled from the stove.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The power lines buzzed in the heat.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"We took the scenic route through the hills.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The choir performed a new arrangement.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The calendar still shows last month.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The clouds parted over the harbor.\" — No apostrophe.\n\nSo, none of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\"\n\n- \"There’ll\" (there will) — has an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"baker’s\" — has an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"market’s\" — has an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nSo, the new text fits Option B.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

look at the options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples contain contractions ending in 't: wasn't, didn't, wouldn't, isn't, hadn't, etc.\n- But many True examples also contain other contractions: I'm, it's, you'll, we've, she's, they'd, etc.\n- Some True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't, but have other contractions: \"I'm sure the baby's blanket wasn't washed.\" (has \"I'm\" and \"wasn't\"), \"She'll explain the lab's results when she's ready.\" (has \"She'll\" and \"she's\"), etc.\n- Some True examples have only possessives: \"The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\" (has \"wasn't\" and \"Alex’s\"), so \"wasn't\" is a contraction ending in 't.\n\nBut let's look at a True example that does NOT have a contraction ending in 't:\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There'll\" is a contraction, but not ending in 't. \"baker’s\" and \"market’s\" are possessives.)\n\nSo Option A does not fit all True examples.\n\nNow, Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\n- \"I'm\" (I + am) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"It's\" (it + is) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"She'll\" (she + will) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"They'd\" (they + would) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"Wasn't\" (was + not) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"Wouldn't\" (would + not) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"Didn't\" (did + not) has an internal apostrophe.\n- \"There'll\" (there + will) has an internal

\"child’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"company’s\", \"board\", \"year’s\", \"island’s\", \"ferry\", \"teacher’s\", \"advice\", \"sailor’s\", \"journal\", etc. all have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nSo, Option B fits all True examples.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"A child waved from the bus window.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She drove along the coast with the windows down.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"He folded a map and put it away.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The museum was closed for renovation.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for

stew.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what

someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- The bus

calendar still shows last month.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n\nNow, let's compare the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples do have contractions ending in 't: can't, won't, didn't, shouldn't, wouldn't, isn't, hasn't, etc.\n- However, there are also True examples with other contractions: She’d, She’ll, I’ve, You’ll, She’s, We’ve, You’d, They’ll, He’s, etc.\n- There are also True examples with possessives: O’Malley’s, gardener’s, train’s, writer’s, teacher’s, cat’s, dog’s, author’s, storm’s, park’s, poet’s, engine’s, someone’s, team’s, painter’s, castle’s, choir’s, Grandma’s, Mom’s, broker’s, brother’s, museum’s, traveler’s, children’s, plane’s, dancer’s, barista’s, Maya’s, Poe’s, today’s, bus’s, etc.\n\nSo Option A does not account for all the True examples, since many are possessives or contractions not ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- \"A word with an internal apostrophe between two letters\" would include all contractions (She’d, She’ll, I’ve, You’ll, She’s, We’ve, You’d, They’ll, He’s, etc.) and all possessives (O’Malley’s, gardener’s, train’s, writer’s, teacher’s, cat’s, dog’s, author’s, storm’s, park’s, poet’s, engine’s, someone’s, team’s, painter’s, castle’s, choir’s, Grandma’s, Mom’s, broker’s, brother’s, museum’s, traveler’s, children’s, plane’s, dancer’s, barista’s, Maya’s, Poe’s, today’s, bus’s, etc.).\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- All False examples do not have any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n\n- \"bird’s\" has an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"wasn’t\" is a contraction with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nSo, according to Option B, this should be True.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\n- The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The storm’s path shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- The bus stops near the art studio.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- A low hum vibrated through the cabin.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The clouds parted over the harbor.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- I bought fresh bread from the corner bakery.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- Coffee spilled onto the wooden floor.\n- A sudden gust blew the door open.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The bakery donated bread to the shelter.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples

No. There is no apostrophe at all.\n\nTherefore, according to Option A, this should be classified as False.\n\nNow, for the final answer to the rule selection:\n\nOption A is correct.\n\nSo, the JSON response is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

etc.\n- These do not end with 't, so Option A cannot be correct, because it would not accept sentences with \"He’ll\", \"I’m\", \"There’s\", etc.\n\nLet's test Option B:\n\n- Option B says: contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- Let's look at \"He’ll\" (He + ’ll), \"I’m\" (I + ’m), \"There’s\" (There + ’s), \"We’ve\" (We + ’ve), \"We’re\" (We + ’re), \"He’s\" (He + ’s),

No.\nDoes it contain a contraction ending with 't? No.\n\nSo, both rules would say False for this example, but the correct rule must be Option A, because Option B does not account for all the True examples (many True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't, but do have a possessive or other contraction).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"She’s hoping the county’s fair doesn’t get rained out.\" contains \"She’s\" and \"county’s\" and \"doesn’t\", so \"doesn’t\" fits, but \"She’s\" and \"county’s\" do not.\n- \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" contains \"barista’s\" and \"didn’t\". \"didn’t\" fits, but \"barista’s\" does not.\n- \"The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\" contains \"knight’s\" and \"couldn’t\". \"couldn’t\" fits, but \"knight’s\" does not.\n\nBut let's look at \"I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\" Here, \"I’m\" and \"vineyard’s\" and \"isn’t\" are present. \"isn’t\" fits, but \"I’m\" and \"vineyard’s\" do not.\n\nBut let's look at \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" Here, \"There’s\" and \"painter’s\" are present. \"There’s\" is a contraction, but it does not end in 't.

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- That chef’s risotto wasn’t on tonight’s menu.\n- He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- He forgot sunscreen and got sunburned.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- The team gathered around the whiteboard.\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- She lit a candle on the balcony.\n- The tide rose faster than expected.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- A bicycle bell rang behind me.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- The meeting began later than planned.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- The calendar still shows last month.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- Our team won the match by two points.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples have contractions ending in 't: doesn't, didn't, isn't, couldn't, wasn't, weren't, hasn't, hadn't, won't, can't, etc.\n- But some True examples have other contractions: you'll, she'll, he'll, there'll, I'd, you'd, she'd, he'll, it'll, don't, etc.\n- For example: \"You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\" (you’ll, you’re)\n- \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (she’d)\n- \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" (he’ll, he’s)\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (o’clock)\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (there’s)\n- \"Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\" (don’t, you’ll)\n\nSo, Option A is too narrow, because it only allows contractions ending in 't, but many True examples have other contractions.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- \"Contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\"\n- Let's check: \"doesn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"weren’t\", \"you’ll\", \"she’d\", \"he’ll\", \"there’ll\", \"I’m\", \"don’t\", \"o’clock\", \"there’s\", \"you’ll\", \"he’s\", \"she’d\", \"I’d\", \"you’d\", \"she’ll\", \"it’ll\", \"don’t\", \"you’ll\", \"there’s\", \"he’d\", \"couldn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"didn’t\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s

on the plate.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n\n- \"I can't believe it's already Friday.\" (True) -- contains \"can't\" (ends with 't)\n- \"It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\" (True) -- contains \"it’s\", \"I’m\", \"they’re\" (none end with 't)\n- \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (True) -- contains \"she’s\", \"she’d\" (she’d ends with 'd, not 't)\n- \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" (True) -- contains \"wasn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The coach’s whistle wouldn’t stop echoing.\" (True) -- contains \"wouldn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\" (True) -- contains \"won’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\" (True) -- contains \"didn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\" (True) -- contains \"didn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\" (True) -- contains \"wouldn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" (True) -- contains \"didn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\" (True) -- contains \"wasn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the

shouldn’t hit the island’s west side.\" (True) -- contains \"shouldn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\" (True) -- contains \"isn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (True) -- contains \"she’d\" (ends with 'd)\n- \"I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\" (True) -- contains \"wasn’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (True) -- contains \"we’ve\" (ends with 've)\n- \"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\" (True) -- contains \"don’t\" (ends with 't)\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (True) -- contains \"there’s\" (ends with 's)\n- \"It’ll be fine if we’re careful with Dad’s car.\" (True) -- contains \"it’ll\" (ends with 'll)\n- \"At five o’clock, the parade began.\" (True) -- contains \"o’clock\" (ends with 'k)\n- \"We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\" (True) -- contains \"we’d\" (ends with 'd)\n- \"They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\" (True) -- contains \"they’ll\" (ends with 'll)\n- \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (True) -- contains \"he’s\" (ends with 's)\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at

to the show.\" (True) -- contains \"she’s\" (ends with 's)\n- \"The painter’s signature under the varnish.\" (True) -- contains \"painter’s\" (ends with 's)\n\nSo, many True examples contain a contraction ending with 't, but many also contain other contractions or possessives (ending with 's, 'd, 'll, etc.), and some only have possessives (e.g., \"painter’s\", \"library’s\", \"poet’s\", \"parade began at five o’clock\"). \n\nNow, let's check the False examples for contractions ending with 't:\n\n- She found a seat near the back. (No contraction)\n- She painted a mural on the north wall. (No contraction)\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light. (No contraction)\n- She wrote a note and slid it under the door.

(No contraction)\n\nSo, none of the False examples have a contraction ending with 't, but also none have any contractions or possessives with an apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLooking at the True examples, every single one contains at least one word with an internal apostrophe (e.g., \"coach’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"she’s\", \"printer’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"o’clock\", \"we’d\", \"plane’s\", \"it’s\", \"I’m\", \"they’re\", \"it’ll\", \"we’re\", \"dad’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"mom’s\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\", \"dancer’s\", \"ankle\", \"wouldn’t\", \"tonight’s\", \"he’s\", \"week’s\", \"company’s\", \"board\", \"didn’t\", \"year’s\", \"museum’s\", \"café\", \"traveler’s\", \"checks\", \"children’s\", \"stage\", \"we’re\", \"camp’s\", \"lights\", \"won’t\", \"painter’s\", \"signature\", \"varnish\", \"library’s\", \"hours\", \"weren’t\", \"city’s\", \"buses\", \"don’t\", \"barista’s\", \"latte\", \"Maya’s\", \"expectations\", \"Claire’s\", \"cousin\", \"twins’\", \"recital\", \"dog’s\", \"tag\", \"shelter’s\", \"records\", \"she’s\", \"she’d\", \"planned\", \"they’ll\", \"ship’s\", \"engine\", \"fails\", \"poet’s\", \"line\", \"wasn’t\", \"teacher’s\", \"advice\", \"I’d\", \"expected\", \"there’s\", \"baker’s\", \"dozen\", \"muffins\", \"left\", \"can’t\", \"it’s\", \"Friday\", \"she’d\", \"sister’s\", \"letter\", \"years\", \"I’m\", \"baby’s\", \"blanket\", \"wasn’t\", \"choir’s\", \"hymn\", \"program’s\", \"index\", \"festival’s\", \"map\", \"vendors’\", \"booths\", \"river’s\", \"edge\", \"shouldn’t\", \"spring\", \"friend’s\", \"carpool\", \"isn’t\", \"eight\").\n\nIn every case, there is a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nIn the False examples, none of the words have an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\nHe’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n\n- \"He’s\" (internal apostrophe)\n- \"village’s\" (internal apostrophe)\n- \"won’t\" (internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, this sentence contains multiple words with internal apostrophes.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nOption B is too narrow, as it would only accept sentences with contractions ending in 't, but many True examples are accepted with other contractions or possessives.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

letters (straight ' or curly ’).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A:\n- \"farmer’s\", \"it’s\", \"chef’s\", \"tonight’s\", \"poet’s\", \"editor’s\", \"children’s\", \"we’re\", \"host’s\", \"ship’s\", \"county’s\", \"dad’s\", \"choir’s\", \"town’s\", \"storm’s\", \"island’s\", \"editor’s\", \"knight’s\", \"barista’s\", \"cat’s\", \"choir’s\", \"city’s\", \"buses\", \"village’s\", \"well\", \"baker’s\", \"apron\", \"vineyard’s\", \"crop\", \"student’s\", \"lab’s\", \"sailor’s\", \"journal\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\", \"father’s\", \"watch\", \"mechanic’s\", \"castle’s\", \"gate\" — all have words with an internal apostrophe (possessive or contraction).\n\nOption B:\n- Only accepts if there is a contraction ending in 't, such as \"can't\", \"won't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", \"couldn't\", \"wasn't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", \"couldn't\", \"wasn't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", \"couldn't\", \"wasn't\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- The cat’s whiskers didn’t fit through the gap.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\n- The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The castle’s gate wouldn’t open at dawn.\n- The lion’s roar didn’t scare the keeper’s horse.\n- My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples and see what they lack:\n\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops.\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs.\n- He poured tea and set out three cups.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The bakery donated bread to the shelter.\n- We hiked until the path disappeared.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- He forgot to water the plants this week.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- The poet signed books after the talk.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's test Option B first:\n- There are many True examples that do NOT have a contraction ending in 't, e.g. \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (\"She'd\" is \"she had\" or \"she would\"), \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" (\"There's\" is \"there is\"), \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We've\" is \"we have\"), etc.\n- Therefore, Option B cannot be correct, because many True examples do not have a contraction ending in 't.\n\nNow, Option A:\n- All True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters, such as \"park’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"sailor’s\", \"today’s\", \"child’s\", \"grandma’s\", \"Julie’s\", \"brewer’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"pianist’s\", \"cat’s\", \"town’s\", \"teacher’s\", \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\", \"bird’s\", \"painter’s\", \"baker’s\", \"artist’s\", \"cat’s\", \"lab’s\", \"team’s\", \"mayor’s\", \"mechanic’s\", \"castle’s\", \"lion’s\", \"keeper’s\", \"friend’s\", \"dog’s\", \"shelter’s\", \"children’s\", etc.\n- All False examples lack such a word.\n\nNow, the new text:\nThe cat’s collar didn’t have the owner’s address.\n\n- \"cat’s\" (internal apostrophe between t and s)\n- \"didn’t\" (internal apostrophe between n and t)\n- \"owner’s\" (internal apostrophe between r and s)\n\nSo, the new text contains multiple words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option A.\n\nFinal answer:\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

For example:\n  - \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (\"He’s\" is \"he is\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\" is \"we have\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (\"I’ve\" is \"I have\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\" (\"She's\" is \"she is\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"I can't believe it's already Friday.\" (has \"can't\", so would be True under B)\n  - \"My friend’s carpool isn’t leaving until eight.\" (has \"isn't\", so True under B)\n  - \"The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\" (has \"didn't\", so True under B)\n  - \"I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\" (has \"isn't\", so True under B)\n  - \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\" is \"we will\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" (\"You've\" is \"you have\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\" (\"It's\" is \"it is\", not ending in 't)\n  - \"The editor’s note wasn’t in today’s issue.\" (has \"wasn't\", so True under B)\n  - \"I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\" (\"I'd\" is \"I would\", not ending in 't)\n\nSo, under Option B, some True examples would be False, because they do not contain a contraction ending in 't.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nHe’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\n\n- \"He’s\" (he is) — internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"village’s\" — possessive, internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"won’t\" — contraction ending in 't.\n\nSo, this sentence would be True under both rules, but since Option A is the only one that fits all the True examples, Option A is correct.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No.\n\nDoes it have a contraction ending with 't? No.\n\nBut, Option A would only accept sentences with a contraction ending in 't, but some True examples have only other contractions (I'll, we're, he's, she's, it's, etc.) or possessives (child's, barista's, etc.), which would not be accepted by Option A.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, would accept any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe, which matches all the True examples.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

For example, \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" contains \"he’ll\" and \"he’s\", but neither ends with 't. \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" contains \"We’ve\", which does not end with 't. \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" contains \"There’ll\", which does not end with 't.\n\nTherefore, Option B cannot be the rule, because there are True examples that do not contain a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, let's test Option A:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's check the True examples:\n- \"She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\" (\"She’s\", \"she’d\")\n- \"The broker’s office isn’t open on Mondays.\" (\"broker’s\", \"isn’t\")\n- \"The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\" (\"student’s\", \"wouldn’t\", \"lab’s\")\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There’ll\", \"baker’s\", \"market’s\")\n- \"We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\" (\"We’ve\", \"children’s\")\n- \"He’ll say he’s okay, though he’s clearly tired.\" (\"He’ll\", \"he’s\")\n- \"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\" (\"It’s\", \"city’s\", \"don’t\")\n- \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (\"She’d\", \"sister’s\")\n- \"I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\" (\"I’d\", \"Poe’s\", \"today’s\")\n- \"They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\" (\"They’d\", \"children’s\")\n- \"You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\" (\"You’ll\", \"actor’s\", \"you’re\")\n- \"The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\" (\"artist’s\", \"didn’t\", \"gallery’s\")\n- \"The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\" (\"teacher’s\", \"wasn’t\", \"I’d\")\n- \"The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\" (\"pianist’s\", \"couldn’t\")\n- \"I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\" (\"I’m\", \"clock’s\", \"didn’t\")\n\nAll of these contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (e.g., \"isn’t\", \"she’s\", \"baker’s\", \"children’s\", \"I’m\", etc.).\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n- \"Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The yogurt expired two days ago.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She opened the window to let in a breeze.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"We walked past a row of quiet shops.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The trail map shows several steep climbs.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The sails filled as the wind shifted.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The statue gleamed in the noon light.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"I found a shell shaped like a heart.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"They waited quietly while the baby slept.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"A bicycle bell rang behind me.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"We waved to the ferry from the pier.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The soup simmered for an hour.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"A cool mist drifted across the field.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"He poured tea and set out three cups.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The meeting began later than planned.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She folded a paper crane at her desk.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The kettle whistled from the stove.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She lit a candle on the balcony.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The weather turned cold after sunset.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"Thunder rolled across the valley.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"She painted a mural on the north wall.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The river flooded after three days of rain.\" (no apostrophe)\n- \"The dog chased its tail in circles.\" (no apostrophe)\n\nNone of these contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\"\n\n- \"island’s\" (apostrophe between d and s)\n- \"wouldn’t\" (apostrophe between n and t)\n\nBoth words contain an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

For example:\n\n- The mechanic’s wrench\n- The sailor’s journal\n- The engine’s rumble\n- The park’s fountain\n- The ranger’s warning\n- The baker’s dozen\n- The editor’s note\n- The poet’s line\n- The baby’s blanket\n- The mayor’s aide\n- The storm’s path\n- The pilot’s log\n- The ship’s bell\n- The river’s edge\n- The camp’s lights\n- The pianist’s hands\n- The brother's guitar\n- The sister’s letter\n- The library’s hours\n- The hotel’s lobby\n- The choir’s robes\n- The island’s ferry\n- The director’s cut\n- The team’s bus\n- The town’s centennial\n\nThese are all possessives, not contractions ending in 't.\n\nAlso, many True examples have contractions that do not end in 't, such as:\n\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\n- She’s bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- We’re sure the camp’s lights won’t shine all night.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n\nSo, Option A is too restrictive.\n\nOption B, on the other hand, accepts any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe (possessives and contractions). All the True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nWe’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n\n- \"We’ll\" (contraction, internal apostrophe)\n- \"everyone’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n- \"Friday’s\" (possessive, internal apostrophe)\n\nSo, this sentence contains multiple words with internal apostrophes.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

For example:\n- \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (possessive \"toddler’s\", \"dad’s\")\n- \"The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\" (possessive \"ranger’s\", \"hikers’\")\n- \"You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\" (possessive \"actor’s\")\n- \"The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\" (possessive \"choir’s\", \"tonight’s\")\n- \"There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\" (possessive \"baker’s\")\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (possessive \"gardener’s\")\n- \"You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\" (possessive \"train’s\")\n- \"The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\" (possessive \"child’s\", \"grandma’s\")\n- \"The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\" (possessive \"manager’s\", \"stadium’s\")\n- \"The ship’s bell wouldn’t stop ringing.\" (possessive \"ship’s\")\n- \"You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\" (possessive \"hotel’s\")\n- \"The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\" (possessive \"dancer’s\", \"tonight’s\")\n- \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (possessive \"Julie’s\")\n- \"The barista’s latte didn’t meet Maya’s expectations.\" (possessive \"barista’s\", \"Maya’s\")\n- \"The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\" (possessive \"park’s\")\n- \"Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\" (possessive \"today’s\")\n- \"Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\" (possessive \"Grandma’s\", \"Mom’s\")\n- \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (possessive \"baker’s\", \"market’s\")\n- \"The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\" (possessive \"choir’s\", \"tonight’s\")\n- \"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\" (possessive \"city’s\", \"buses’\")\n\nSo, Option A is satisfied in all True cases.\n\nNow, Option B: Only True if there is a contraction ending in 't.\nBut, for example, \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" does not have a contraction ending in 't, but is True.

But many True examples do not have such contractions, e.g., \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\" (no 't contraction), \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" (has \"weren’t\", so fits), \"Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\" (has \"isn’t\", so fits), \"We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\" (\"We’ll\" is \"we will\", not ending in 't). So, Option B would not accept all True examples.\n\nOption A: Accepts any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters. Let's check: \"O’Malley’s\" (yes), \"plane’s\" (yes), \"wasn’t\" (yes), \"student’s\" (yes), \"lab’s\" (yes), \"festival’s\" (yes), \"cat’s\" (yes), \"owner’s\" (yes), \"doctor’s\" (yes), \"shouldn’t\" (yes), \"island’s\" (yes), \"It’s\" (yes), \"someone’s\" (yes), \"team’s\" (yes), \"dancer’s\" (yes), \"tonight’s\" (yes), \"baker’s\" (yes), \"today’s\" (yes), \"river’s\" (yes), \"library’s\" (yes), \"editor’s\" (yes), \"knight’s\" (yes), \"ranger’s\" (yes), \"hikers’\" (yes), \"vendors’\" (yes), \"hotel’s\" (yes), \"painter’s\" (yes), \"coach’s\" (yes), \"mechanic’s\" (yes), \"mayor’s\" (yes), \"Grandma’s\" (yes), \"Mom’s\" (yes), \"choir’s\" (yes), \"county’s\" (yes), \"chef’s\" (yes), \"poet’s\" (yes), \"editor’s\" (yes), \"baker’s\" (yes), \"Julie’s\" (yes), \"tomorrow’s\" (yes).\n\nAll True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, the new text: \"He taped a note to the refrigerator.\" There is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

All False examples lack any apostrophe.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (can't, won't, didn't, etc.). But many True examples do not have such a contraction (e.g., \"O’Malley’s pub serves the city’s best stew.\"), and some True examples have only possessive 's or other contractions not ending in 't.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the correct rule.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"A\"}",

No. For example, \"He’ll wear his father’s watch to tomorrow’s interview.\" contains \"He’ll\" and \"father’s\", but neither ends with 't.\n- \"It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\" contains \"don’t\", which fits, but \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\" contains \"He’d\", which does not end with 't.\n- Many True examples have contractions like \"I’m\", \"She’s\", \"He’ll\", \"You’ll\", \"It’s\", \"They’re\", \"She’d\", \"I’d\", \"We’re\", \"She’ll\", \"I’ll\", etc., none of which end with 't.\n\nSo Option B cannot be the rule.\n\nNow, Option A:\n\n- Does every True example contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters?

the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A: Only accepts sentences with contractions ending in 't (can't, won't, didn't, wasn't, etc.)\n\nOption B: Accepts any sentence with a word containing an internal apostrophe (e.g., it's, can't, baker's, wasn't, etc.)\n\nLooking at the True examples, many of them have words like \"it’s\",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples:\n\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- He’s improved since last week’s practice.\n- The student’s thesis wouldn’t load on the lab’s computer.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- I’d rather read Poe’s tales than today’s news.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The pianist’s hands couldn’t reach the chord.\n- Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\n- The poet’s line wasn’t easy to parse.\n- Claire’s cousin isn’t coming to the twins’ recital.\n- The choir’s hymn wasn’t in the program’s index.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- It’s someone’s turn to wash the team’s jerseys.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- The river’s edge shouldn’t be this close in spring.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n\nNow, the False examples:\n\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n- The festival serves breakfast all day.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- The sails filled as the wind shifted.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\n- Lunch was served on the veranda.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The soup simmered for an hour.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n\nNow, let's look at the two options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A: Does every True example contain a contraction ending with 't? Let's check a few:\n\n- wasn’t, didn’t, wouldn’t, isn’t, couldn’t, shouldn’t, isn’t, didn’t, wasn’t, etc. Yes, many of the True examples have these.\n- But some True examples: \"She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\" (she’ll), \"He’s improved since last week’s practice.\" (he’s), \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" (I’ve), \"It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\" (it’s, I’m), \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (they’re), etc. These are contractions, but not ending in 't.\n\nSo Option A is too narrow.\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet’s check if all True examples have a word with an internal apostrophe:\n\n- wasn’t, didn’t, wouldn’t, isn’t, couldn’t, shouldn’t, isn’t, didn’t, wasn’t, etc. Yes.\n- she’ll, he’s, I’ve, it’s, they’re, you’ve, I’d, we’ll, etc. Yes.\n- Also, possessives: author’s, festival’s, writer’s, book’s, etc. Yes.\n\nNow, False examples: \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" No internal apostrophe. \"We watched meteors until nearly dawn.\" No. \"The dog chased its tail in circles.\" No. \"The phone battery died during the call.\" No. \"The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\" No.\n\nSo, Option B fits all the True and False examples.\n\nNow, the new text:\n\nShe learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option B, the answer is False.\n\nNow, the final answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

The True examples always have at least one contraction (wasn't, didn't, can't, etc.) or a possessive (baker’s, writer’s, etc.), but let's check if any True example is True only because of a possessive.\n\nFor example: \"The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\" This has both possessives and a contraction ending in 't.\n\nBut what about \"She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\"? \"She’ll\" is a contraction, but not ending in 't.\n\nSo, Option A would not accept \"She’ll proof the writer’s draft when she’s back.\" because \"she’ll\" does not end in 't.\n\nBut this is marked True.\n\nSimilarly, \"We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\" has \"we’ll\" and \"everyone’s\", \"Friday’s\", but no contraction ending in 't.\n\nSo Option A would not accept this, but it's marked True.\n\nTherefore, Option A is too restrictive.\n\nOption B: Accepts any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters. This would include all contractions (she’ll, it’s, didn’t, etc.) and all possessives (baker’s, writer’s, etc.).\n\nBut let's check the False examples: do any of them have a word with an internal apostrophe? Let's check:\n\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing. (No)\n- We shared a taxi to the train station. (No)\n- The cinema reopened with a classic film. (No)\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop. (No)\n- We walked past a row of quiet shops. (No)\n- The bakery across town closed last month. (No)\n- The tide rose faster than expected. (No)\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light. (No)\n- The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes. (No)\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart. (No)\n- A small fox darted across the road. (No)\n- The trail map shows several steep climbs. (No)\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier. (No)\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad. (No)\n- Thunder rolled across the valley. (No)\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge. (No)\n- The bakery donated bread to the shelter. (No)\n- Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit. (No)\n- He taped a note to the refrigerator. (No)\n- A low hum vibrated through the cabin. (No)\n- A cool mist drifted across the field. (No)\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down. (No)\n- We arrived early and found good seats. (No)\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence. (No)\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk. (No)\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class. (No)\n- She painted a mural on the north wall. (No)\n- She lit a candle on the balcony. (No)\n- She brewed mint tea in a clay pot. (No)\n\nNone of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nTherefore, Option B fits all the True and False examples.\n\nNow, the new text is:\n\nWe toured the castle under a gray sky.\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe? No.\n\nTherefore, according to Option B, it should be classified as False.\n\nSo, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Option A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nLet's check some True examples:\n- \"I can't believe it's already Friday.\" (contains \"can't\" and \"it's\" — both contractions ending with 't)\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" (\"You’ve\" — contraction, but not ending with 't;

\"train’s\" — possessive)\n\nNow, let's look at some False examples:\n- \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The cinema reopened with a classic film.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"We rented a cabin near the falls.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The meeting began later than planned.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"She folded a paper crane at her desk.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"We waved to the ferry from the pier.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"A child waved from the bus window.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"She brewed mint tea in a clay pot.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"She found a seat near the back.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The poet signed books after the talk.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"Thunder rolled across the valley.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The phone battery died during the call.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The printer jammed halfway through the report.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"We arrived early and found good seats.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"A small fox darted across the road.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The bus stops near the art studio.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"We hiked until the path disappeared.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"She painted a mural on the north wall.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"The museum was closed for renovation.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"He set an alarm for six in the morning.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"He copied the file to a thumb drive.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"He taped a note to the refrigerator.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n- \"He poured tea and set out three cups.\" (no contractions or possessives)\n\nBut, in the True examples, there are many sentences that are marked True even though they do not contain a contraction ending with 't. For example:\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" (\"You’ve\" — contraction, not ending with 't)\n- \"I’ll check the pilot’s log when I’m onboard.\" (\"I’ll\" — contraction, not ending with 't)\n- \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (\"We’ve\" — contraction, not ending with 't)\n- \"She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\" (\"She’ll\" — contraction,

not ending with 't)\n\nSo Option A cannot be the rule, because there are True examples that do not have a contraction ending with 't.\n\nNow, let's look at Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's check the True examples:\n- \"I can't believe it's already Friday.\" (\"can't\", \"it's\" — both have internal apostrophes)\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" (\"You’ve\", \"mechanic’s\" — both have internal apostrophes)\n- \"The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\"

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The dog’s tag didn’t match the shelter’s records.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- The park’s fountain wasn’t turned on yet.\n- It’s odd that the city’s buses don’t run late.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The poet’s odes weren’t her editor’s favorite.\n- The bird’s wing wasn’t broken after all.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- Sofia’s recipe doesn’t call for baker’s yeast.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- The team’s bus couldn’t fit under the bridge.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\n- The author’s note wasn’t at the book’s end.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\n- The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\n- The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- We waved to the ferry from the pier.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- The choir performed a new arrangement.\n- A violin solo echoed through the hall.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- We heard laughter from the open doorway.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- Coffee spilled onto the wooden floor.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- The team gathered around the whiteboard.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- Snow fell softly over the old bridge.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- I found a shell shaped like a heart.\n- The stairs creaked under the heavy box.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n- The yogurt expired two days ago.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- The pie on the counter smells amazing.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n\n- Many True examples contain contractions ending with 't: didn't, wasn't, doesn't, couldn't, wouldn't, weren't, isn't, don't.\n- However, some True examples do not have a contraction ending with 't, e.g., \"He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\" (\"He’s\" is \"he is\", not ending with 't), \"You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\" (\"You’ll\" is \"you will\"), \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" (\"They’re\" is \"they are\"), \"I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\" (\"I’m\" is \"I am\"), \"There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\" (\"There’ll\" is \"there will\"), \"We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\" (\"We’re\" is \"we are\"), \"She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\" (\"She’d\" is \"she had\" or \"she would\"), \"We’ve packed the toddler’s snacks and dad’s umbrella.\" (\"We’ve\" is \"we have\"), \"He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\" (\"He’d\" is \"he had\" or \"he would\"), \"You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\" (\"You’d\" is \"you had\" or \"you would\"), \"There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\" (\"There’ll\" is \"there will\"), \"I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\" (\"I’m\" is \"I am\"), \"The director’s cut wasn’t on the festival’s schedule.\" (\"director’s\" is possessive, not a contraction), \"The museum’s café didn’t accept traveler’s checks.\" (\"museum’s\" is possessive), \"The scouts’ leader couldn’t find the trail’s marker.\" (\"scouts’\" is possessive plural), \"Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\" (\"Don’t\" is a contraction ending with 't, but \"you’ll\" is not).\n\nSo, Option A does not fit all True examples.\n\nNow, Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\n- All the True examples contain at least one word with an internal apostrophe: contractions (didn’t, wasn’t, doesn’t, couldn’t, wouldn’t, weren’t, isn’t, don’t, he’s, you’ll, they’re, I’m, there’ll, we’re, she’d, we’ve, he’d, you’d, director’s, museum’s, scouts’, today’s, etc.) or possessives (dog’s, shelter’s, printer’s, manager’s, stadium’s, baker’s, today’s, city’s, actor’s, town’s, baby’s, company’s, year’s, choir’s, poet’s, editor’s, bird’s, book’s, neighbor’s, toddler’s, dad’s, author’s, book’s, harbor’s, vineyard’s, festival’s, traveler’s, scouts’, trail’s, today’s).\n- All False examples lack any word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, the new text: \"They waited quietly while the baby slept.\"\n\n- There is no word with an internal apostrophe in this sentence.\n\nTherefore, according to Option B, this should be classified as False.\n\nNow, which rule is correct?

Option B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's check this:\n\n- \"You’ve borrowed the mechanic’s wrench again.\" — \"You’ve\" (apostrophe between u and v), \"mechanic’s\" (apostrophe between c and s).\n- \"The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\" — \"library’s\" (apostrophe between y and s),

\"isn’t\", \"Mom’s\".\n- \"You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\" — \"You’ll\", \"actor’s\", \"you’re\".\n- \"He’s sure the village’s well won’t run dry.\" — \"He’s\", \"village’s\",

\"The brewer’s stout didn’t suit everyone’s taste.\" — \"brewer’s\", \"didn’t\", \"everyone’s\".\n- \"The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\" — \"choir’s\", \"didn’t\", \"tonight’s\".\n- \"The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\" — \"knight’s\", \"couldn’t\".\n- \"I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\" — \"I’ve\", \"gardener’s\".\n- \"That chef’s

\"neighbor’s\".\n- \"The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\" — \"island’s\", \"wouldn’t\".\n\nAll of these have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples:\n\n- \"A narrow path leads to the lighthouse.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"A sudden gust blew the door open.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The bus stops near the art studio.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"She wrote a note and slid it under the door.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The sails filled as the wind shifted.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\" — No apostrophes.\n- \"The statue gleamed in the noon light.\" — No

No apostrophes.\n- \"Thunder rolled across the valley.\" — No apostrophes.\n\nSo, Option B fits perfectly: True if there is a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\"\n\n- \"It’s\" — apostrophe between t and s.\n- \"I’m\" — apostrophe between I and m.\n- \"they’re\" — apostrophe between y and r.\n\nAll three are words with internal apostrophes between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- The dancer’s ankle wouldn’t handle tonight’s routine.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- It wasn’t easy to find the sailor’s journal.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- The baker’s dozen still wasn’t enough for today’s rush.\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- The baker’s apron wasn’t as white as it’s supposed to be.\n- They’d ordered the children’s meals ahead of time.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- You’ll see the actor’s cameo if you’re patient.\n- They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\n- The artist’s work didn’t fit the gallery’s theme.\n- At five o’clock, the parade began.\n- There’ll be a baker’s stall at the market’s corner.\n- We’d hoped the doctor’s report wouldn’t be delayed.\n- The choir’s robes didn’t arrive for tonight’s service.\n- The island’s ferry wouldn’t run during storms.\n- We’d better check the plane’s tire pressures.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- It’s raining and I’m sure they’re staying home.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- She’d saved her sister’s letter for years.\n- They’ll cancel if the ship’s engine fails.\n- The ranger’s warning didn’t reach the hikers’ radios.\n- He’d promised to water the neighbor’s plants.\n- I’m afraid the vineyard’s crop isn’t ripening.\n- The choir’s director didn’t schedule tonight’s rehearsal.\n- The festival’s map didn’t show vendors’ booths.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- They waited quietly while the baby slept.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\n- He learned Spanish during a summer abroad.\n- He added basil to the simmering sauce.\n- The cookies cooled on a wire rack.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\n- The museum was closed for renovation.\n- We rented a cabin near the falls.\n- I left the keys on the kitchen table.\n- The restaurant serves breakfast all day.\n- A cool mist drifted across the field.\n- She learned to juggle in a weekend class.\n- We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\n- He folded a map and put it away.\n- The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\n- The hallway smelled faintly of lemon.\n- He balanced the tray with one hand.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- The power lines buzzed in the heat.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n- The statue gleamed in the noon light.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- The lamp on the desk flickered once.\n- A small fox darted across the road.\n- A child waved from the bus window.\n- Bright orange leaves covered the sidewalk.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n\nNow, let's look at the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test these options:\n\nOption A: Contractions ending with 't (e.g., didn't, won't, isn't, wasn't, wouldn't, etc.)\n- Many True examples have \"didn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"couldn't\", etc.\n- But some True examples have \"I’ve\", \"We’ll\", \"You’d\", \"They’re\", \"There’s\", \"It’s\", \"We’re\", \"She’d\", \"They’ll\", \"He’d\", \"I’m\", etc., which are contractions but do not end with 't.\n- So Option A would not accept all the True examples.\n\nOption B: Any word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- \"didn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"couldn't\", \"I’ve\", \"We’ll\", \"You’d\", \"They’re\", \"There’s\", \"It’s\", \"We’re\", \"She’d\", \"They’ll\", \"He’d\", \"I’m\", etc., all have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- Also, possessives like \"company’s\", \"everyone’s\", \"dancer’s\", \"gardener’s\", \"sailor’s\", \"today’s\", \"baker’s\", \"cat’s\", \"library’s\", \"baker’s\", \"children’s\", \"farmer’s\", \"Julie’s\", \"actor’s\", \"town’s\", \"artist’s\", \"gallery’s\", \"o’clock\", \"market’s\", \"doctor’s\", \"choir’s\", \"island’s\", \"plane’s\", \"painter’s\", \"host’s\", \"sister’s\", \"ship’s\", \"ranger’s\", \"hikers’\", \"neighbor’s\", \"vineyard’s\", \"choir’s\", \"director’s\", \"festival’s\", \"vendors’\", \"baker’s\", \"muffins\", etc., all have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n- All True examples have at least one word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nNew text: We arrived early and found good seats.\n\nDoes it have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No.\n\nDoes it have a contraction ending with 't? No.\n\nSo, both rules would classify this as False.\n\nBut, the correct rule must be the one that matches all the True and False examples.\n\nOption A would not accept \"I’ve\", \"We’ll\", \"You’d\", \"They’re\", \"There’s\", \"It’s\", \"We’re\", \"She’d\", \"They’ll\", \"He’d\", \"I’m\", etc., which are True examples but do not end with 't.\n\nOption B would accept all True examples and reject all False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Many of them have possessives (\"teacher’s\", \"cat’s\", \"neighbor’s\", \"hotel’s\", etc.), and many have contractions (\"didn’t\", \"wasn’t\", \"wouldn’t\", \"isn’t\", \"won’t\", \"couldn’t\", \"didn’t\", \"doesn’t\", \"I’m\", \"you’ll\", \"we’ll\", \"they’re\", \"she’d\", \"he’s\", etc.).\n\nBut, let's look at the False examples. Some of them have possessives (\"cat curled up on the warm laptop\" - no possessive, \"pie on the counter\" - no possessive, \"dog chased its tail\" - \"its\" is not a possessive with an apostrophe, \"He copied the file\" - no possessive, etc.). None of the False examples have a word with an internal apostrophe.\n\nNow, let's look at the new text:\n\nThe teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n\nThis sentence contains:\n- \"teacher’s\" (possessive, with an internal apostrophe)\n- \"wasn’t\" (contraction ending with 't)\n- \"I’d\" (contraction with an internal apostrophe, not ending with 't)\n\nIf Option A were correct, only sentences with a contraction ending in 't would be accepted. But in the True examples, we see sentences accepted that have only possessives (e.g., \"Grandma’s pie isn’t as sweet as Mom’s.\"), and sentences with contractions not ending in 't (e.g., \"I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\"), and sentences with both.\n\nIf Option B were correct, any sentence with a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive or contraction) would be accepted. All True examples have at least one such word, and all False examples do not.\n\nTherefore, Option B is the correct rule.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

So, Option A would not accept this, but it's marked True.\n- \"There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\" — \"There’s\" (not ending with 't), \"painter’s\" (possessive). Again, Option A would not accept, but it's True.\n- \"They’re planning the town’s centennial next year.\" — \"They’re\" (not ending with 't), \"town’s\" (possessive). Again, Option A would not accept, but it's True.\n\nSo Option A is not consistent with the True examples.\n\nNow, Option B:\n\n- \"It’ll\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (i.e., \"it\" + \"will\" = \"it’ll\").\n- \"There’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (\"there\" + \"is\").\n- \"They’re\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (\"they\" + \"are\").\n- \"Dad’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"painter’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"town’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"cat’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"didn’t\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"wasn’t\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"children’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"She’ll\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"lab’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"ship’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"wouldn’t\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"brother's\" —

apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"she’d\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"She’ll\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"writer’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"barista’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"latte\" — no apostrophe, but \"didn’t\" is present (contraction).\n- \"They’ll\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"ship’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"dog’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"shelter’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"We’ll\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"everyone’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"Friday’s\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (possessive).\n- \"can't\" — internal apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n- \"it's\" —

apostrophe between two letters (contraction).\n\nSo, Option B is consistent with all the True examples.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples for Option B:\n\n- \"We took the scenic route through the hills.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"We arrived early and found good seats.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A cool mist drifted across the field.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Our team won the match by two points.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The pastry flaked apart on the plate.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The museum was closed for renovation.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Lunch was served on the veranda.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The printer jammed halfway through the report.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"She found a seat near the back.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The cat curled up on the warm laptop.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The kids built a fort from cardboard boxes.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"Traffic slowed to a crawl near the exit.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"He added basil to the simmering sauce.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"He folded the laundry and stacked it neatly.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"She drove along the coast with the windows down.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"I left the keys on the kitchen table.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The sails filled as the wind shifted.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A small fox darted across the road.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"We packed sandwiches for the picnic.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The dog chased its tail in

quiet.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"We hiked until the path disappeared.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"The meeting began later than planned.\" — No apostrophe.\n- \"They waited quietly while the baby slept.\" — No apostrophe.\n\nSo, Option B is consistent with the False examples as well.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\n\"She painted a mural on the north wall.\"\n\nDoes it contain a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters? No, it does not.\n\nTherefore, according to Option B, the answer should be False.\n\nNow, for the rule selection:\n\nOption A is not consistent with the True examples, as many True examples have contractions or possessives that do not end with 't.\n\nOption B is consistent with all True and False examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

Let's check if this fits all True examples:\n\n- She’ll (apostrophe between l and l)\n- I’m (apostrophe between I and m)\n- He’s (apostrophe between e and s)\n- There’s (apostrophe between e and s)\n- It’s (apostrophe between t and s)\n- She’d (apostrophe between e and d)\n- We’d (apostrophe between e and d)\n- They’d (apostrophe between y and d)\n- Didn’t (apostrophe between n and t)\n- Wasn’t (apostrophe between n and t)\n- Wouldn’t (apostrophe between n and t)\n- Shouldn’t (apostrophe between n and t)\n- Weren’t (apostrophe between e and r)\n- etc.\n\nAll of these have an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the False examples: None of them have a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nNow, let's check the new text:\n\nThe pie on the counter smells amazing.\n\nThere is no word with an internal apostrophe between two letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct rule is Option B.\n\nJSON response:\n\n{\"answer\":\"B\"}",

      "response": "Let's analyze the examples and the two rule options.\n\nFirst, let's look at the True examples and see what they have in common:\n\n- You’d laugh at the cat’s attempt to climb.\n- We’re early, but the host’s table isn’t ready.\n- We’ll need Julie’s notes before tomorrow’s meeting.\n- The mayor’s office wasn’t answering citizens’ emails.\n- We’ll need everyone’s input before Friday’s call.\n- The region’s drought wouldn’t end with one storm.\n- I can't believe it's already Friday.\n- The library’s hours weren’t posted clearly.\n- We’ll cross the farmer’s field if it’s allowed.\n- The mayor’s aide said she’d return calls.\n- She's bringing her brother's guitar to the show.\n- She’ll explain the lab’s results when she’s ready.\n- It’d help if the weatherman’s forecast weren’t so vague.\n- There’ll be fireworks over the harbor’s mouth.\n- Don’t lose today’s ticket; you’ll need it later.\n- There’s a baker’s dozen of muffins left.\n- You’d think they’d call ahead, but they didn’t.\n- The pilot’s seat wasn’t adjusted to Alex’s height.\n- The teacher’s advice wasn’t what I’d expected.\n- The manager’s keys didn’t fit the stadium’s lock.\n- He’s sure the printer’s error wasn’t his fault.\n- She’s taken on more than she’d planned this year.\n- There’s a painter’s signature under the varnish.\n- You’re right; the hotel’s lobby smelled of pine.\n- The child’s drawing didn’t fit on grandma’s fridge.\n- The company’s board didn’t approve last year’s budget.\n- I’m guessing the clock’s hands didn’t move.\n- You’ll miss the train’s departure if you’re late.\n- I’ve misplaced the gardener’s invoice somewhere.\n- We’ve reserved children’s seats near the stage.\n- The knight’s honor couldn’t be questioned.\n- I’m sure the baby’s blanket wasn’t washed.\n\nNow, let's look at the False examples:\n\n- The power came back after midnight.\n- The printer jammed halfway through the report.\n- She sketched mountains in a small notebook.\n- A tall fence surrounds the garden.\n- We planted tomatoes beside the back fence.\n- The mailbox was full of flyers and ads.\n- We toured the castle under a gray sky.\n- We stacked firewood beside the shed.\n- A soft humming came from the attic fan.\n- A sparrow perched on the stone arch.\n- The archive stored boxes in a cool room.\n- A rainbow appeared over the stadium.\n- The phone battery died during the call.\n- The dog chased its tail in circles.\n- He set an alarm for six in the morning.\n- The weather turned cold after sunset.\n- A gentle rain darkened the pavement.\n- The bookstore hosts a poetry reading tonight.\n- She opened the window to let in a breeze.\n- Thunder rolled across the valley.\n- She drove along the coast with the windows down.\n- The lake shimmered under the morning sun.\n- The bakery across town closed last month.\n- We took the scenic route through the hills.\n- A low hum vibrated through the cabin.\n- He copied the file to a thumb drive.\n- She painted a mural on the north wall.\n- We shared a taxi to the train station.\n- She found a seat near the back.\n- My watch beeped right on the hour.\n\nNow, let's compare the two rule options:\n\nOption A: The string is accepted when it contains a contraction ending with 't (for example, can't or won't).\n\nOption B: The string is accepted when it contains a word with an internal apostrophe between two letters (straight ' or curly ’).\n\nLet's test Option A:\n- \"can't\", \"won't\", \"isn't\", \"wasn't\", \"wouldn't\", \"didn't\", \"couldn't\", \"shouldn't\", \"don't\", \"didn't\", \"wasn't\",
